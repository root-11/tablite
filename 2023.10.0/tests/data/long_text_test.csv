RAYMOND, Deputy Secretary to the Commission Having regard to Article 25 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms; Having regard to the application introduced on 17 April 1986 by Govert van GINSBERGEN against the Netherlands and registered on 28 May 1986 under file No. 12191/86; Having regard to the report provided for in Rule 40 of the Rules of Procedure of the Commission; Having deliberated; Decides as follows: THE FACTS The applicant is a retired lawyer of Dutch nationality, born on 4 September 1909.  He lives in Brasschaat, Belgium. On 18 September 1985, the applicant instituted civil proceedings on behalf of a client before the Regional Court (Arrondissementsrechtbank) of Breda.  The case concerned a tort action against the secretary of an advisory committee which had declared that the Collective Agreement for the Cleaning and Window-cleaners Trade (CAO van het Schoonmaak-en Glazenwassersbedrijf) did not apply to the contractual relationship between the applicant's client and his employer. On 18 March 1986, the Regional Court declared itself incompetent ratione loci to deal with the case.  The Court recalled that Section 126 para. 1 of the Code of Civil Procedure states that actions such as the one before it must be introduced with the court of the place of residence of the summoned party.  The case was then referred to the competent court which was the Regional Court of Amsterdam.  The Regional Court subsequently considered that the lawyer had made a blatant mistake in bringing the case before the wrong court and ordered, relying on Section 58 of the Code of Civil Procedure, that the applicant should bear the costs of the proceedings in person.  These amounted to 520 Dfl. Section 58 of the Code of Civil Procedure provides, inter alia, that lawyers who have been negligent in the exercise of their profession can be ordered to pay the costs in person without possibility of recovering them from their client.  It appears that, in these cases, the lawyer cannot lodge an appeal against the court order.  According to Section 332 of the Code of Civil Procedure, only the parties in the civil proceedings can appeal against judgments of a Regional Court. COMPLAINTS The applicant complains that the court order to pay the costs of the proceedings was issued without a prior hearing of the applicant concerning his alleged mistake, and that there was no remedy available for him against the order.  He alleges that Section 58 of the Code of Civil Procedure, in general and as applied in his case, violates Article 6 of the Convention. The applicant also alleges that discrimination on the ground of his age was the basis of the court order complained of. THE LAW 1.      The applicant has first complained that the Regional Court's decision whereby he was ordered to pay the costs of the proceedings personally was made without prior hearing and that there existed no possibility of appeal against the order.  In this respect he has alleged that Section 58 of the Dutch Code of Civil Procedure, both in general and as applied in his case, violates Article 6 (Art. 6) of the Convention. The Commission recalls that, under Article 25 (ARt. 25) of the Convention, it is not competent to examine in abstracto the conformity of national legislation with the Convention (see, inter alia, No. 8307/78, Dec. 11.7.80, D.R. 21, p.116).  It can therefore only deal with the applicant's complaint insofar as it relates to the court order that the applicant bear the costs of the proceedings personally. The Commission understands the applicant to be relying on the right to a fair hearing as guaranteed by Article 6 (Art. 6) of the Convention. Article 6 para. 1 (Art. 6-1) provides, as far as relevant, as follows: ""In the determination of his civil rights and obligations or of any criminal charge against him, everyone is entitled to a fair and public hearing within a reasonable time by an independent and impartial tribunal established by law..."" The question arises in the present case whether this provision is applicable to the proceedings which resulted in the order that the applicant pay the cost of the proceedings. The fact that the court order against the applicant was made in the course of civil proceedings cannot, in itself, bring about the applicability of Article 6 para. 1 (Art. 6-1) of the Convention, since the applicant was not a party to those proceedings (cf., mutatis mutandis, No. 10615/83, Dec. 3.7.84, D.R. 38, p. 213).  The Commission must next examine whether these proceedings and the court order involved the determination of the applicant's civil rights or obligations within the meaning of Article 6 para. 1 (Art. 6-1). It appears from the facts that the basis for a court order such as the one issued against the applicant depends, in the first place, upon an assessment by the court that the lawyer in question has in fact been negligent.  The present applicant disputes that he has been negligent at all and points out that he has correctly interpreted the Dutch law concerning the competence of the civil courts. The Commission recalls its decision in No. 10615/83 (loc. cit,) which examined a similar complaint where it held as follows: ""The Commission recognises that in imposing the requirements that the applicant pay the costs ""thrown away"" on 6 September 1983 it was necessary for the judge to evaluate to some extent the applicant's conduct of the case which had resulted in the question of an adjournment.  That this evaluation could only be partial and superficial is well-illustrated by the mere fact that the applicant was not present to explain matters to the Court, still less to defend his professional reputation. Nevertheless, the Commission concludes that the judge's investigation of this aspect of the applicant's conduct of proceedings was conducted, not in the context of an evaluation of his professional capabilities as such, or of his professional relationship with his client, but as an aspect of the proper administration of justice, responsibility of which ultimately lies with the judiciary.  The Commission therefore concludes that the judge's order, and the 12191/86 exceptional proceedings, in the absence of the applicant and with scant prior notice to him, must properly be regarded as disciplinary proceedings in the context of the administration of justice and the proper organisation of the work of the courts, and hence did not involve a determination of the applicant's civil rights or obligations."" Likewise in the present case, the Commission considers that the Regional Court's evaluation of the applicant's professional conduct of the proceedings was based on the requirement that the applicable rules on competence ratione loci of the courts are observed in order to avoid unnecessary proceedings and that the exceptional court order must properly be regarded as a disciplinary measure in the context of the administration of justice and the proper organisation of the work of the courts. Moreover, the Commission notes that the court order concerning the costs of the proceedings had no bearing, either directly or indirectly on the right of the applicant to continue to exercise his profession, since the applicant had already retired from the profession before the court's decision (cf, mutatis mutandis, Eur. Court H.R. Pudas judgment of 27 October 1987, Series A no. 125, p. 16 para. 37). The Commission therefore concludes that the decision whereby the applicant was ordered to pay the costs of the proceedings did not involve a determination of his civil rights or obligations. The Commission must also consider whether the court order constituted the determination of a criminal charge against the applicant within the meaning of Article 6 para. 1 (Art. 6-1) of the Convention. Again, the Commission recalls its decision on the admissibility of application No. 10615/83, in which it applied the principles developed by the Court in case of Engel and others (judgment of 8 June 1976, Series A no. 22, p. 35, para. 82).  In that case the Commission found that the nature of the order to pay costs involved an investigation of the applicant's conduct of proceedings, in the exercise of judicial control of the proper administration of justice, with a view to preventing avoidable delay in the conduct of proceedings.  The Commission further noted that the maximum penalty which could be imposed by the judge was that the lawyer personally pay the actual costs ""thrown away"" as a result of his conduct. The Commission finds that these considerations also apply in the present case and therefore arrives at the same conclusion that, although the court order involved the imposition of a sanction on the applicant, the nature of the proceedings and the severity of the penalty are not such as to constitute the ""determination of a criminal charge"" within the meaning of Article 6 para. 1 (Art. 6-1) of the Convention. It follows that the provisions of Article 6 para. 1 (Art. 6-1) of the Convention are not applicable to the proceedings resulting in the court order imposed on the applicant, and that the applicant's complaints under Article 6 para. 1 (Art. 6-1) must be rejected as incompatible ratione materiae within the meaning of Article 27 para. 2 (Art. 27-2) of the Convention. 2.     As regards the applicant's complaint that the court order discriminated against him on grounds of age, the Commission recalls that it has found that the proceedings complained of fall outside the ambit of Article 6 para. 1 (Art. 6-1) of the Convention.  Nor can it be said that the facts in the present case fall within the ambit of other substantive provisions of the Convention and the Protocols.  It follows, therefore, that Article 14 (Art. 14) does not apply in the present case (cf., for example, Eur.  Court H.R., Rasmussen judgment of 28 November 1984, Series A no. 87, p. 12 para. 29) and that this part of the application must also be rejected as incompatible ratione materiae with the provisions of the Convention within the meaning of Article 27 para. 2 (Art. 27-2) of the Convention. For these reasons, the Commission DECLARES THE APPLICATION INADMISSIBLE. Deputy Secretary to the Commission          President of the Commission (J. RAYMOND)                          (C.A.

C.A. NØRGAARD, President E. BUSUTTIL G. JÖRUNDSSON A.S. GÖZÜBÜYÜK A. WEITZEL J.-C. SOYER G. BATLINER H. VANDENBERGHE Mrs.  G.H. THUNE Sir  Basil HALL MM.  F. MARTINEZ C.L. ROZAKIS Mrs.  J. LIDDY Mr.  J. RAYMOND, Deputy Secretary to the Commission Having regard to Article 25 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms; Having regard to the application introduced on 26 May 1986 by S. Austria and registered on 11 July 1986 under file No. 12262/86; Having regard to the report provided for in Rule 40 of the Rules of Procedure of the Commission; Having deliberated; Decides as follows: THE FACTS The facts of the case, as submitted by the applicant, may be summarised as follows: The applicant, an Austrian citizen apparently born in 1946, is a labourer resident in Linz.  Before the Commission he is represented by Dr.  G. Tews, a lawyer practising in Linz. The applicant has been married since 1974 and the father of six children, four of whom live with their parents.  One daughter lives in a childrens' home, another daughter, A., has been living with her grandparents since her birth in 1972. I On 18 November 1984 the daughter A. was visiting her parents. According to the applicant's subsequent submissions, on this occasion A. told him that her breast was hurting.  The applicant then went into the children's room with the daughter, locked the door and examined A.'s breast, whereupon he advised her to visit a doctor. The next morning at school, two friends of A. went to the teacher, Mrs.  J., and told her that something terrible had happened to A.  Mrs.  J. questioned A. and then called the police. According to the police minutes (Bericht) prepared on 19 November 1984 by the Linz Federal Police Direction (Bundespolizei- direktion), A. told the police that she had been abused by her father. She claimed that he had gone into a room with her and, after taking off his trousers and shirt, had lain on her.  Thereby he had asked her about his genitals and had shown her how to make children.  A. stated that the applicant had not touched her and had not undressed completely.  During the occurrences she had not called for help as the applicant had ordered her to keep quiet.  In A.'s submissions, the applicant frequently beat her, particularly when he was drunk, for which reasons she often had bruises. On 19 November 1984 the applicant was arrested on suspicion inter alia of having committed an indecent act with a minor.  On the same day, the applicant explained before the police that A. had complained of pains in her breast, whereupon he had examined it. However, he had thought nothing of doing so and had not done so to be aroused.  The applicant denied A.'s statements, namely that he had undressed or made certain movements, or that he had threatened her. The applicant also denied having caused bruises to the children by beating them. On 20 November 1984 the police questioned A.  She denied having complained about breast pains, or that the applicant had touched her, though she had clearly felt him being aroused.  According to the same police minutes, two police officers visited the room concerned.  They noted that the bed was in the darkest corner of the room, thus contradicting the applicant's statement that he had wanted to look at his daughter.  According to the police minutes, when visiting the room, A. had told the police officers that the applicant had lain on her.  The police minutes concluded that the impression gained was that A. was telling the truth. The applicant was also questioned by the police on 20 November 1984.  He was informed that A. upheld her statements.  The applicant now submitted that while examining his daughter he had lain sideways between A.'s legs.  He denied all other accusations. Thereupon, the Linz Federal Police Direction filed with the Linz Public Prosecutor's Office (Staatsanwaltschaft) a criminal report (Strafanzeige) in which it suspected the applicant of having abused A. to submit to indecent acts. On 22 November 1984 the applicant was informed by the investigating judge at the Linz Regional Court (Landgericht) of the criminal proceedings instituted against him.  The applicant claimed that he was not guilty and requested A. to be heard as soon as possible.  He also announced that he would file an appeal against his detention on remand. The investigating judge at the Linz Reginal Court questioned A. on 23 November 1984.  The latter was informed of her right under S. 152 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, according to which, as a member of the accused's family, she was exempted from the obligation to give evidence.  However A. expressed the wish to give evidence. After reiterating the occurrences on 18 November 1984 she pointed out that the applicant had threatened to beat her with a rubber hose if she spoke to others about the occurrences. On 23 November 1984 the applicant was also heard by the investigating judge.  He withdrew his appeal against his detention on remand.  He explained that there was a rubber hose in the house with which he occasionally threatened the children, though he had never caused them any bruises.  In respect of the events on 18 November 1984 the applicant told the investigating judge that it was possible and probable that he had been aroused during the incident but he could no longer remember.  He might also have made certain movements, though again he could not remember. The investigating judge then pointed out that in fact the applicant was now admitting the offences.  The applicant thereupon admitted having committed an indecent act with a minor.  However, he denied having undressed or having asked A. about his genitals, or having threatened her.  He also could not recall whether or not he had been aroused. On 29 November 1984 the applicant requested his release from detention, stating that he had nothing to do with the whole affair. He was released on 24 December 1984. On 10 June 1985 the Public Prosecutor's Office indicted the applicant, inter alia, of having committed an indecent act with a minor. II The trial took place at the Linz Regional Court on 30 September 1985.  A. stated at the outset that she would avail herself of her right under S. 152 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (Strafprozessordnung) to refuse to give evidence. The applicant, who was assisted by a lawyer, was heard first. He submitted that he was not guilty, and that his statements before the investigating judge on 23 November 1984 were incorrect.  A. herself had on 18 November 1984 lifted up her pullover, and if she said that she had felt him being aroused, this was probably due to a bunch of keys which he had in his pocket. The applicant explained that on 23 November 1984 before the investigating judge he had been upset (aufgeregt) and had been pressed hard (bedrängt) by the investigating judge who had told him that, if he did not admit his guilt, he would have to stay in detention until the trial.  He also did not remember everything he had said on that occasion.  In respect of the rubber hose, the applicant explained that he only threatened his children with it.  In the applicant's submissions, A. hated him and now wanted to ""land him in it"" (""hineintunken"").  Another son, M., had told him of a conversation with A., whereby the latter said that she had made up the whole story and that she wished he, the applicant, would be dead. The applicant's wife, heard as a witness, stated that she could not recall whether her husband had ever been aggressive towards the children.  She believed that A. had reported the applicant to the police because she hated him.  One of A.'s brothers, M., had reported to her, the mother, that A. had told him that she had made up the whole story.  A second brother had also heard this. The teacher, Mrs.  J., testified that she had once noticed bruises on A.'s legs and arms.  A. had then told her that the applicant had thrown wooden slippers at her.  Mrs.  J. recalled how A. had told her about the events on 18 November 1984.  In Mrs.  J.'s opinion, A. did not lie very often, and she did not have the impression that A. was now making up a story.  Mrs.  J. also did not have the impression that A. had convinced herself (reingelernt) of the story, though she could also not exclude it.  She observed that she was a person to whom A. had always had confidence. The Court also heard the medical opinion of a professor who concluded that the applicant was on the verge of debility (Grenzdebilität) and inclined to chronic alcoholism.  It was possible that such persons could become aggressive and also commit indecent acts. Despite the applicant's objections, the police minutes recording A.'s statements before the police and the investigating judge were then read out in Court according to S. 252 para. 2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.  According to S. 252 para. 1, minutes of the questioning of witnesses may be read out at the trial if, without being entitled thereto, they refuse to give evidence. According to the practice of the Austrian courts, the statements which the same witnesses had previously made before the police nevertheless could be read out as they were considered as documents within the meaning of S. 252 para. 2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.  This provision provides that reports on inspections and tests as well as other types of documents and papers relevant to the matter must be read out unless both parties waive their reading. Upon the applicant's request, the Court then asked the applicant's son, M., to testify.  However, M. invoked his right under S. 152 of the Code of Criminal Procedure not to do so. On 30 September 1985 the Regional Court convicted the applicant of forcing A. to commit an indecent act, of having committed an indecent act with a minor, of abusing his position of authority, and of exercising compulsion (Nötigung) on her.  The applicant was sentenced to one year's imprisonment. In its judgment the Court found it established that on 18 November 1984 the applicant locked himself into a room with A., sat next to her on a bed, and then suddenly threw her back onto the bed.  He then undressed, with the exception of his underwear, thereby threatening her, if she would call out.  The Court found that the applicant then rubbed his genitals on those of A. After being aroused, he stopped and dressed.  He then threatened to beat A. with a rubber hose if she reported the incident to anybody. The Court noted that the applicant had admitted the offences before the investigating judge.  If before the Court he now argued that he only did so to be released from detention, the Court found that he had then expressly stated that he was admitting the offences. It was also not credible if the applicant later claimed that he no longer recalled what he had said before the investigating judge. On the other hand, the Court regarded A.'s statements before the police as credible.  In particular, she had not spoken of a gross sexual act (massives sexuelles Vorgehen), as would be likely if she were fabricating a story, and her statement to Mrs.  J. coincided with that before the police.  The Court also regarded as reliable the teacher's personal opinion that A. was telling the truth.  If the applicant and his wife claimed that one son, M., had heard A. stating that she was making up the whole story, the Court found this to be too vague to call in question A.'s statement. Against this judgment the applicant filed with the Supreme Court (Oberster Gerichtshof) a plea of nullity (Nichtigkeitsbe- schwerde) and an appeal (Berufung).  In his plea of nullity, he complained, inter alia, that the Regional Court relied on police minutes. On 20 March 1986 the Supreme Court dismissed the applicant's plea of nullity.  The Court found, inter alia, that S. 252 of the Code of Criminal Procedure compelled the previous court to read out the police minutes, as long as the applicant had the possibility, by means of his own statements and of requests for the taking of evidence, subsequently to weaken or even to contradict the evidence adduced, including the police minutes.  This had been the case in the proceedings at issue in view of the fact that the applicant's wife, Mrs.  J., and a medical expert had been heard at the trial, and an attempt had even been made to hear M. On 10 April 1986, the Supreme Court also dismissed the applicant's appeal. COMPLAINTS The applicant complains under Article 6 paras. 1 and 3 (d) that he did not have a fair and public hearing and that he could not put questions to the witness incriminating him.  He submits in particular that the police minutes recording A.'s statements on 19 and 20 November 1984 constituted the principal evidence incriminating him.  Despite his objections these minutes were read out at the trial, after A. had availed herself of her right under S. 152 of the Code of Criminal Procedure not to give evidence.  Yet neither he nor his lawyer had been present when the police minutes were being prepared. The applicant observes that in Austrian legal practice the accused or his representative are not as a rule present when in preliminary proceedings a witness is heard who could refuse to give evidence according to S. 152 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Yet time and again the witness concerned later will indeed invoke this right.  In the applicant's submissions, the majority of legal writers in Austria share the view that such minutes should only be read out at the trial if they have been prepared in the framework of the same guarantees as the evidence reached during the trial. THE LAW The applicant submits that the main incriminating evidence employed by the Linz Regional Court for his conviction constituted the police minutes recording A.'s statements on 19 and 20 November 1984. He complains that contrary to Article 6 para. 3 (d) (Art. 6-3-d) of the Convention the Court relied on these minutes although he could not put questions to the witness concerned.  As a result he also did not have a fair and public hearing within the meaning of Article 6 para. 1 (Art. 6-1) of the Convention. With regard to the judicial decisions of which the applicant complains, the Commission recalls that, in accordance with Article 19 (Art. 19) of the Convention, its only task is to ensure the observance of the obligations undertaken by the Parties in the Convention.  In particular, it is not competent to deal with an application alleging that errors of law or fact have been committed by domestic courts, except where it considers that such errors might have involved a possible violation of any of the rights and freedoms set out in the Convention.  The Commission refers, on this point, to its constant case-law (see e.g.  No. 458/59, Dec. 29.3.60, Yearbook 3 pp. 222, 236; No. 5258/71, Dec. 8.2.73, Collection 43 pp. 71, 77; No. 7987/77, Dec. 13.12.79, D.R. 18 pp. 31, 45).  It follows that the Commission cannot examine for instance whether or not the testimony of the witness A. was credible. It is true that the applicant also complains under Article 6 paras. 1 and 3 (d) (Art. 6-1, 6-3-d) that he did not have a fair and public hearing in that the Regional Court, when convicted him, relied on police minutes in respect of which he did not have the opportunity to put questions to the witness concerned. As regards the conduct of the proceedings before the Regional Court, the Commission sees no indication that the applicant, who was assisted by a lawyer, could not present his case properly or that the proceedings were unfairly conducted by this Court.  Thus, at the trial the applicant was heard by the Court together with his wife, a teacher, and a medical expert.  When reaching its judgment the Regional Court examined both the exculpatory testimony of the applicant and his wife as well as the incriminating evidence.  In respect of A.'s statements, the Court considered in detail whether or not they were credible.  The Court concluded that the incriminating evidence concerning the applicant was sufficiently credible ant that the exculpatory evidence was not, and on this basis it convicted the applicant. Insofar as the applicant complains that the Regional Court relied on police minutes in respect of which he could not put questions to the witness concerned, the Commission recalls that the reading out of statements at the trial, to which the judgment later has recourse, cannot in itself be regarded as being inconsistent with these provisions.  Nevertheless the use made of these statements must comply with the rights of the defence.  On the one hand, a person charged with a criminal offence must have the opportunity to examine or have examined witnesses against him, particularly if he has not had the opportunity at an earlier stage in the proceedings to question the persons whose statements are read out at the trial and later are relied upon in the judgment of the Court concerned (see Eur.  Court H.R., Unterpertinger judgment of 24 November 1986, Series A No. 110, p. 14f. para. 31).  On the other hand, Article 6 paras. 1 and 3 (d) (Art. 6-1, 6-3-d), which are aimed at securing in criminal proceedings equality between the defence and the prosecution, do not give an accused an unlimited right to obtain the appearance of, and to examine witnesses before court (see No. 9000/80, Dec. 11.3.82, D.R. 28 p. 127). In the present case the Commission notes that, at the trial before the Regional Court, A. did not give evidence as a witness.  The Court then relied in its judgment on police minutes recording A.'s statements before the police on 19 and 20 November 1984, without the applicant or his lawyer being present on those occasions.  Upon the applicant's plea of nullity, the Supreme Court held that the Regional Court had been obliged under S. 252 of the Code of Criminal Procedure to read out the police minutes at the trial. In this respect, however, the applicant has not alleged before the Commission that he could not inform himself of the contents of the police minutes before the trial.  He has also not shown that he filed a request with the Court to put certain questions to the witness A. Moreover, the Commission notes that the Regional Court did not rely exclusively for its conviction of the applicant on the statements made by A. before the police on 19 and 20 November 1984.  Thus, in its judgment of 30 September 1985 the Court took into consideration statements made by the applicant himself, before the investigating judge, in which he in fact admitted the offences.  The Court further relied on the testimony of the teacher, Mrs.  J., before the Court in whom A. had always had confidence, and whom at the trial the applicant was able to question. Finally, the Commission considers that it was in the interest of the witness A. herself, a minor who was also the victim of the indecent act, to be spared the experience of being questioned at the trial about the occurences with her father, the applicant. As a result, the Commission does not regard the recourse by the Regional Court to the police minutes, without the applicant having been able to put questions to A., as being inconsistent with Article 6 paras. 1 or 3 (d) (Art. 6-1, 6-3-d).  It follows that the above complaints do not disclose any appearance of a violation of the rights set out in Article 6 of the Convention.  The Commission concludes that the application is manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 27 para. 2 (Art. 27-2) of the Convention. For these reasons, the Commission DECLARES THE APPLICATION INADMISSIBLE. Deputy Secretary to the Commission        President of the Commission (J. RAYMOND)                         (C. A.

ROZAKIS Mrs.  J. LIDDY Mr.  J. RAYMOND, Deputy Secretary to the Commission Having regard to Article 25 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms; Having regard to the application introduced on 24 March 1986 by Jan Åke KARLSSON against Sweden and registered on 25 August 1986 under file No. 12356/86; Having regard to the report provided for in Rule 40 of the Rules of Procedure of the Commission; Having deliberated; Decides as follows: THE FACTS The facts of the case, as submitted by the applicant, may be summarised as follows. The applicant is a Swedish citizen, born in 1953 and residing at Östra Hoby, Sweden.  He is a priest in the Swedish State Church. Before the Commission he is represented by Mr.  Göran Ravnsborg, Lund, Sweden. The applicant graduated from the University of Lund in 1977 and has since held various posts in the State Church.  In 1984 the post of vicar in the parish of Örkened in the Diocese of Lund was advertised.  According to the Act on the Election of Priests (lagen om prästval), the diocesan chapter (domkapitlet) lists a number of qualified candidates, one of whom is chosen by the parishoners.  The applicant put himself forward as a candidate together with three others. The applicant is a supporter of certain religious views, so- called ""gammal kyrklighet"", for which reason he is opposed to the ordination of women.  For this reason, and bearing in mind that the parish of Örkened has two priests of which the vicar is the superior, the Diocesan Chapter of Lund, before deciding whether the candidates could be considered qualified, asked the applicant whether he would be willing to co-operate with a woman clergyman as assistant priest. In reply the applicant questioned the Diocesan Chapter's right to request answers to such hypothetical questions and submitted that he would carry out his task to the best of his ability. On 22 May 1985 the Diocesan Chapter decided in a majority vote to declare the applicant unqualified as a candidate to the post of vicar.  In its decision it stated the following: ""In summary, the Diocesan Chapter finds that, since (the applicant) has clearly shown through his actions up to now that he cannot be expected to co-operate with female colleagues, he does not possess the ability and the qualities deemed necessary for satisfactory work in a supervisory position in a parish with more than one priest; hence it finds (the applicant) unqualified for the office in question in accordance with Section 6 of the Act (1957:577) of the Election of Priests."" On 10 June 1985 the applicant appealed against this decision to the Swedish Government claiming that it be annulled, that he be declared qualified as a candidate for the post of vicar and that he be put on the list of qualified candidates. On 23 January the Government rejected the appeal.  They pointed out, however, that the applicant's views on women priests could not disqualify him for the post but found, as did the Diocesan Chapter, that the applicant would not co-operate with women priests in such a way that he could fulfil his duties as vicar. COMPLAINTS The applicant complains of the decision taken by the Diocesan Chapter of Lund and upheld by the Government that he was unqualified to obtain a post as vicar.  This, in his opinion, amounts to a violation of his right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion and his right to freedom of expression as secured by Articles 9 and 10 of the Convention, read separately as well as in conjunction with Article 14 of the Convention. The applicant also maintains that the refusal to allow him to apply for election to the office of vicar exclusively by means of a bureaucratic decision by the Government discloses a violation of Articles 11, 13 and 18 of the Convention. Finally the applicant alleges that the decision to disqualify him is founded on an arbitrary and hypothetical reasoning which cannot be reconciled with the principles of Article 6 para. 2 of the Convention. THE LAW 1.      The applicant complains that the refusal to accept him as candidate for a post as vicar constitutes a violation of his right to freedom of thought, conscience and freedom as secured by Article 9 (Art. 9) of the Convention.  The Commission notes that this complaint concerns the decision of a State Church, confirmed on the applicant's appeal by the Swedish Government. Insofar as the applicant's complaint relates to the fact that he was not accepted as being qualified for a post as vicar, the Commission recalls the cases of Glasenapp and Kosiek (Eur.  Court H.R., Glasenapp and Kosiek judgments of 28 August 1986, Series A, Nos. 104 and 105) where the Court expressed in distinct terms that access to the civil service is not a right guaranteed by the Convention.  The Court futhermore stated that no interference of a right of the Convention was at hand when the heart of the complaint raised before the Convention organs was measures taken by the authority in order to satisfy itself that a person applying for a post possessed the necessary personal qualifiation for the post in question. Nevertheless the Commission has considered the applicant's complaint under Article 9 (Art. 9) of the Convention as submitted by him. Article 9 (Art. 9) provides: ""1.  Everyone has the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion;  this right includes freedom to change his religion or belief and freedom, either alone or in community with others and in public or private, to manifest his religion or belief, in worship, teaching, practice and observance. 2.  Freedom to manifest one's religion or beliefs shall be subject only to such limitations as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society in the interests of public safety, for the protection of public order, health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others."" The Commission recalls in this respect its constant case-law according to which Article 9 (Art. 9) does not oblige the High Contracting Parties to ensure that churches within their jurisdiction grant religious freedom to their members and servants (cf. for example No. 7374/76, Dec. 8.3.76, D.R. 5 p. 157).  The freedom of religion thus does not include the right of a clergyman, within the framework of a church in which he is working or to which he applies for a post to practise a special religious conception.  If the applicant's views on women priests and thus his intentions regarding co-operation with female colleagues is found to be incompatible with the view generally held by the church in question the latter is not obliged to accept the applicant as its servant. On the other hand if the requirements imposed upon a person by the church should be in conflict with his convictions he should be free to leave his office, and the Commission regards this as an ultimate guarantee of his right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion. In the present case the Commission recalls that the applicant holds a post in the Swedish State Church and there is nothing to show that the applicant should fear a dismissal from his present post. Furthermore, the applicant has not shown that he has been under any pressure to change his views or that the has been prevented from manifesting his religion or belief.  On the contrary it appears clearly from the decision of the Government that the applicant's views on women priests were not held to disqualify him but that he did not possess the necessary qualifications for the post which, however, as set out above, is a question which falls outside the scope of Article 9 (Art. 9). Consequently the Commission finds that the decisions complained of did not in any way interfere with the exercise of the applicant's rights under Article 9 (Art. 9) of the Convention and this part of the application is therefore manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 27 para. 2 (Art. 27-2) of the Convention. 2.      As regards the applicant's complaint that there has been a breach of his right to freedom of expression as guaranteed by Article 10 (Art. 10) of the Convention, the Commission considers that the same reasoning applies mutatis mutandis to the applicant's complaint under this Article as to the complaint under Article 9 (Art. 9).  It follows that there has been no interference with the applicant's right as guaranteed by Article 10 (Art. 10) and this aspect of the application is therefore also manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 27 para. 2 (Art. 27-2) of the Convention. 3.      The applicant has also complained that his case discloses a violation of Article 13 (Art. 13) of the Convention in that he did not have at his disposal an effective remedy which could rectify the alleged violations of the Convention. The Commission does not find it necessary in the present case to consider whether in the light of its above conclusions the applicant had an arguable claim necessitating a remedy under Article 13 (Art. 13) of the Convention but recalls that the applicant could and did bring his complaints before the Government for consideration. The Commission finds that this remedy for the purposes of the present case was sufficient to fulfil the requirements of Article 13 (Art. 13) of the Convention.  The applicant's complaint under this provision is thus in any event manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 27 para. 2 (Art. 27-2) of the Convention. 4.      The applicant has furthermore alleged that the refusal to accept him as a candidate for the post in question was based on a reasoning which cannot be reconciled with the principles of Article 6 para. 2 (Art. 6-2) of the Convention. The Commission recalls that the presumption of innocence laid down in Article 6 para. 2 (Art. 6-2) only applies in cases where an applicant has been charged with a criminal offence.  This is not the case here. Consequently this part of the application must be rejected as being incompatible ratione materiae under Article 27 para. 2 (Art. 27-2) of the Convention. 5.      The Commission has finally considered the remainder of the applicant's complaints as submitted by him.  However, the documents and the information submitted by him do not disclose any substantiated facts which could justify a further examination of these complaints. It follows that the remainder of the applicant's complaints is manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 27 para. 2 (Art. 27-2) of the Convention. For these reasons, the Commission DECLARES THE APPLICATION INADMISSIBLE Deputy Secretary to the Commission       President of the Commission (J. RAYMOND)                        (C. A. NØRGAARD)",,

ROZAKIS Mrs.  J. LIDDY Mr.  J. RAYMOND, Deputy Secretary to the Commission Having regard to Article 25 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms; Having regard to the application introduced on 9 October 1986 by Mehmet SEN against Austria and registered on 17 October 1986 under file No. 12463/86; Having regard to the report provided for in Rule 40 of the Rules of Procedure of the Commission; Having deliberated; Decides as follows: THE FACTS The facts of the case, as submitted by the applicant, may be summarised as follows: The applicant, a Turkish citizen born in 1948, is a labourer resident at Rankweil in Austria.  Before the Commission he is represented by Dr.  W.L. Weh, a lawyer practising in Bregenz. The facts submitted by the applicant may be summarized as follows: I In the evening of 20 October 1984, a number of persons, among them the applicant, were at the A.-Restaurant in Bregenz, a locality frequented mainly by Turkish citizens.  At closing time after about 1 am on 21 October 1984, some persons were standing outside the restaurant.  Some shots were fired.  Thereafter, the applicant and two other persons, S.E. and A.Si, got into a car and drove off. In the morning of 21 October 1984, one of the two managers of the restaurant, N.I., found bullet shells in front of the restaurant. He reported this to the police.  As a political motive could not be excluded, the investigations were handed over to the Vorarlberg Police Direction (Sicherheitsdirektion). Various persons were questioned by the Bregenz police, whereby their statements were recorded as minutes (Niederschrift).  Thus, N.I. stated on 3 December 1984 that he had been present when on 21 October 1984 at 2 am, among a group of about 20 persons, a man fired some shots. N.I. noticed how A.Sö. apparently pushed this man into the car.  When he asked A.Sö. what was happening, he was told to mind his own business. Also on 3 December 1984, K.I., the son of the other manager, told the police that he had been in the restaurant and had not seen the goings-on, though he had heard that this person had been sitting at the same table as A.Sö. On 4 December 1984, A.Sö. stated before the Bregenz police that he had been present when a person unknown to him fired three or four shots sideways into the ground.  However, he was able to describe to the police the features of the person concerned.  He, A.Sö., had been sitting with this person at the same table in the restaurant during the evening.  A.Sö. also explained that it was customary in certain parts of Turkey to fire shots after a festive occasion. Also on 4 December 1984, S.E. and A.Si. told the police that they had not been able to see who had fired the shots.  Both had then got into a car and driven off together with the applicant. The applicant explained on 4 December 1984 to the police that he had not heard any shots while being in the restaurant, and that after leaving the locality he had driven away in a car. On 12 December 1984 A.Sö. made a further statement before the Rankweil police.  He stated that at the Rankweil police station he had been confronted with a man, apparently the applicant.  He recognised this man without doubt as being the person who had fired the shots at 1 am on 21 October 1984 and with whom he had previously been sitting at the table in the restaurant. On 12 December 1984 the Vorarlberg Police Direction filed with the Bregenz District Court (Bezirksgericht) a criminal report (Straf- anzeige) according to which the applicant was urgently suspected of having fired four shots among a group of people, without a licence and without any particular purpose.  The Report reiterated various statements made before the police.  It noted that A.Sö. had identified with certainty the applicant as the person who had fired the shots. The Report also stated that S.E. and A.Si. were urgently suspected of having given false testimony before the police in order to protect the applicant. S.E. and A.Si. were later acquitted of these charges.  However, on 11 March 1985 the Bregenz District Court issued a Criminal Order (Strafverfügung) in which it convicted the applicant of the offence of having unlawfully possessed and carried a handgun (Faustfeuerwaffe), and sentenced him to 30 daily rates of 150.-AS or, alternatively, to 15 days' imprisonment. II The applicant filed an objection (Einspruch) against the Criminal Order of 11 March 1985, thus initiating oral proceedings. His trial opened before the Bregenz District Court on 23 April 1985.  The applicant who was assisted by an interpreter was heard first.  He stated that when the events had happened on 21 October 1984 he had been so strongly under the influence of alcohol that he would not have been able to hold a handgun in his hand. S.E. and A.Si. were then heard as witnesses.  They stated that they were unaware of who had fired the shots.  N.I. stated that he was seeing the applicant for the first time at the hearing. The proceedings were then adjourned, inter alia, in order to obtain the address of A.Sö. At a further hearing on 22 July 1985, K.I. stated that as he had been in the restaurant he was unaware of the person who had fired the shots.  A.Sö. was then heard as a witness.  He stated that he was able to understand colloquial German, but not special expressions such as ""doubtless"" (""zweifelsfrei"").  In his testimony he altered his previous statements before the police to the extent that he was now no longer sure whether or not the applicant had been the person firing the shots, as he had only seen the person concerned from the back. Moreover, he had not been sitting with the applicant at the same table.  As to the confrontation with the applicant, A.Sö. stated that on that occasion he had been sitting in a police car.  A man, possibly the applicant, was sitting in a van, about 30 metres away.  This man was requested to get out of the van, walk to the police station, and back again to the van.  In A.Sö.'s recollection this man looked similar to the man who had fired the shot. The proceedings were then adjourned, inter alia, to hear the police officers who had originally questioned the various witnesses. A further hearing took place on 22 October 1985.  A.Sö. was heard again.  He declared that his statement before the police was incomplete as no interpreter had then been present.  The two police officers were then heard.  One officer, who was also questioned by the applicant's lawyer, stated that he had not had any language difficulties when questioning A.Sö., either on 4 or on 12 December 1984 and an interpreter had therefore been regarded as unnecessary.  The other officer also stated that there had been no difficulties in communicating with A.Sö.  Later, when sitting in the police car, A.Sö. had definitely identified the applicant as the person concerned.  He, the police officer, had specially instructed A.Sö. to look closely at the person, whereupon A.Sö. had repeated his statement. On 22 October 1985 the Bregenz District Court convicted the applicant of having unlawfully possessed and carried a handgun and sentenced him to 30 daily rates at 120.-AS or, alternatively, to 15 days' imprisonment. The Court considered that A.Sö. had been manager of the A.-restaurant from 1982-1984, and that his grasp of the German language was correspondingly good.  The statements of the two police officers also clearly disproved A.Sö.'s testimony before the Court concerning his knowledge of German.  The Court found that the testimony of N.I. and in particular A.Sö. made it clear that the applicant, who at that time had probably been slightly under the influence of alcohol, had fired the shots.  A.Sö. had in fact on two occasions, on 4 and 12 December 1984, incriminated the applicant, on 4 December by stating that the latter had been sitting with him at the same table and on 12 December by identifying him.  Later, at the hearings of 22 July 1985 and 22 October 1985, A.Sö. had modified his statement by explaining that on the evening in question he had not sat at the same table as the applicant and had only from the back seen the man firing the shots. III The applicant filed a plea of nullity (Nichtigkeitsbeschwerde) and an appeal (Berufung).  Thereby he relied on S. 281 para. 4 of the Austrian Code of Criminal Procedure (Strafprozessordnung).  According to this provision, a plea of nullity may be filed, if during the trial, and contrary to the application of the person concerned, an interim decision (Zwischenerkenntnis) is handed down which disregards or interprets incorrectly, inter alia, a law, the observance of which would be required in a procedure securing the rights of the defence. The applicant submitted in his plea of nullity that the District Court had disregarded such a law, namely Article 6 of the Convention, inasmuch as A.Sö. had been questioned by the police without an interpreter being present.  The applicant submitted further that no witness at the trial had incriminated him.  The Court had had to rely for its decision on the police minutes of A.Sö.'s statement. Yet, when A.Sö. had been questioned, before the police, the applicant had not been able to put questions.  In his appeal, the applicant requested a conditional sentence. After a further hearing, the Feldkirch Regional Court (Landesgericht) on 9 April 1986 suspended the applicant's sentence on probation.  The remainder of his appeal and his plea of nullity were dismissed. The Regional Court found that a plea of nullity according to S. 281 para. 1 (4) required an application of the person concerned as well as an interim decision of the Court during the trial.  In the present case such an interim decision had not been given.  The Court therefore decided to examine the applicant's plea of nullity under S. 281 para. 1 (3) of the Code of Criminal Procedure, which provision permits such a remedy if during the trial a legal provision has been disregarded, the compliance with which the law orders under a threat of nullity.  The Court found that Article 6 of the Convention did not extend para. 1 (3) of S. 281.  The Regional Court finally considered that the District Court had been obliged, under S. 252 para. 2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, to read out the police minutes and that its assessment of the evidence could not be reproached. COMPLAINTS The applicant now complains under Article 6 of the Convention that before the Austrian Courts concerned not one element of proof was adduced which would have incriminated him in a concrete manner.  Not one witness identified before the Courts the applicant as the person who had fired the shots.  The applicant thus claims that the proceedings were not fair in that the District Court had to rely for its judgment on police minutes recording a statement of A.Sö. before the police which he later retracted.  Yet A.Sö. had been questioned by the police without an interpreter being present.  It was possible therefore that the minutes were wrong.  Before the District Court, when an interpreter was present, A.Sö. no longer identified the applicant as the person concerned.  This testimony should therefore be regarded as the more credible one.  It was arbitrary (unsachlich) that the District Court regarded A.Sö.'s statement before the Court as wrong and yet did not prosecute him.  On the other hand, the two police officers heard before the District Court were merely giving hear-say evidence. The applicant sees a further breach of Article 6 of the Convention in that the Court of Appeal decided to examine under S. 282 para. 1 (3) of the Code of Criminal Procedure his plea of nullity complaints rather than under (4) of that provision, and that the Court did not find Article 6 of the Convention relevant for his plea of nullity. THE LAW The applicant complains that he was convicted by the District Court although not one witness identified him before that Court as the person who had fired the shots.  He also complains that he did not have a fair trial within the meaning of Article 6 (Art. 6) of the Convention. With regard to the judicial decisions of which the applicant complains, the Commission recalls that, in accordance with Article 19 (Art. 19) of the Convention, its only task is to ensure the observance of the obligations undertaken by the Parties in the Convention.  In particular, it is not competent to deal with an application alleging that errors of law of fact have been committed by domestic courts, except where it considers that such errors might have involved a possible violation of any of the rights and freedoms set out in the Convention.  The Commission refers, on this point, to its constant case-law (see e.g.  No. 485/59, Dec. 29.3.60, Yearbook 3 pp. 222, 236; No. 5258/71, Dec. 8.2.73, Collection 43 pp. 71, 77; No. 7987/77, Dec. 13.12.79, D.R. 18 pp. 31, 45).  It follows that in the present case the Commission cannot examine for instance whether or not the testimony of the witnesses was credible. It is true that the applicant also complains under Article 6 (Art. 6) of the Convention that the District Court had to rely for its judgment on police minutes recording a statement of A.Sö.  Yet when the latter had made his statement before the police an interpreter had not been present.  The applicant also complains that the Regional Court decided to examine his plea of nullity complaint under S. 282 para. 1 (3) instead of (4) of the Code of Criminal Procedure and that the Court found Article 6 (Art. 6) of the Convention irrelevant. As regards the court proceedings in general, the Commission sees no indication that the applicant who was represented by a lawyer could not present his case properly before the District Court or the Regional Court, or that the proceedings were improperly conducted by these Courts.  Thus, at the trial the applicant was heard by the District Court together with a number of witnesses.  Throughout the trial an interpreter was present.  When reaching its judgment the District Court considered both the incriminating and exculpatory testimony of various witnesses.  The Court thereby regarded the incriminating evidence concerning the applicant as sufficiently credible and it based its conviction thereupon, whereby it considered that the grasp of the witness concerned of the German language was good. The applicant has also complained of the recourse by the District Court to the police minutes when reaching its judgment.  The Commission has examined this complaint under Article 6 paras. 1 and 3 (d) (Art. 6-1, 6-3-d) of the Convention.  It recalls that the reading out of statements at the trial, to which the judgment later has recourse, cannot in itself be regarded as being inconsistent with these provisions.  Nevertheless, the use made of these statements must comply with the rights of the defence.  A person charged with a criminal offence must have the opportunity to examine or have examined witnesses against him, particularly if he has not had the opportunity at an earlier stage in the proceedings to question the persons whose statements are read out at the trial and later are relied upon in the judgment of the Court concerned (see Eur.  Court H.R., Unterpertinger judgment of 24 November 1986, Series A No. 110, p. 14f., para. 31). In the present case the Commission notes that the District Court relied in its judgment of 22 October 1985 on the statements made by N.I. and A.Sö. before the police.  Upon the applicant's plea of nullity, the Regional Court held that the District Court had been obliged under S. 252 of the Code of Criminal Procedure to read out the police minutes at the trial. In this respect, however, the applicant has not alleged before the Commission that he could not inform himself of the contents of the police minutes before the trial.  Moreover, the Commission observes that in particular the witnesses N.I. and A.Sö. appeared at the trial and that the applicant had the opportunity to question them.  It follows that the recourse by the District Court to the police minutes cannot be regarded as being inconsistent with Article 6 para. 1 or 3 (d) (Art. 6-1, 6-3-d) of the Convention. Insofar as the applicant complains that the Regional Court decided to examine his plea of nullity under S. 282 para. 1 (3) instead of (4) of the Code of Criminal Procedure, and that the Court did not consider Article 6 (Art. 6) of the Convention as relevant in this context, the Commission recalls that Article 6 para. 1 (Art. 6-1) does not prevent the High Contracting Parties from regulating the manner in which the public shall have access to courts in order to ensure the proper administration of justice (see No. 6916/75, Dec. 8.10.76, D.R. 6 p. 107).  In the present case the Commission notes that the Regional Court decided that the conditions under S. 281 para. 1 (4) were not met and then proceeded to examine the applicant's plea of nullity under para. 1 (3).  Nevertheless, the Commission observes that in fact the Regional Court examined in substance the applicant's complaints concerning in particular the recourse by the District Court to the police minutes.  Thereby the Regional Court concluded that the District Court had been obliged to read out the police minutes and that its assessment of the evidence could not be reproached. As a result, the above complaints do not disclose any appearance of a violation of the rights set out in Article 6 (Art. 6) of the Convention.  The Commission concludes that the application is manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 27 para. 2 (Art. 27-2) of the Convention. For these reasons, the Commission &_DECLARES THE APPLICATION INADMISSIBLE. Deputy Secretary to the Commission    President of the Commission (J. RAYMOND)                    (C. A. NØRGAARD)",,

RAYMOND, Deputy Secretary to the Commission Having regard to Article 25 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms; Having regard to the application introduced on 14 July 1986 by by Maureen and Duncan AMPLEFORD against the United Kingdom and registered on 30 April 1987 under file No. 12937/87; Having regard to the report provided for in Rule 40 of the Rules of Procedure of the Commission; Having deliberated; Decides as follows: THE FACTS The applicants, United Kingdom citizens, are a mother and son living in London.  They are represented before the Commission by Messrs.  Binks Stern and Partners, solicitors of London.  The facts of their case, as submitted by their representatives, may be summarised as follows: The second applicant was born on 14 April 1975.  At the relevant time, he attended, as a boarder, an independent school in Sussex. On 2 October 1985 at about 7:30 p.m. the second applicant was sitting with other boys doing homework in a classroom.  He was crying because he was homesick.  The headmaster entered the room and walked over to the second applicant's desk and shouted at him, ""Shut up, shut up"".  The headmaster took hold of the boy's shirt collar and pulled him over the desk and hit him on the bottom through his shorts with his bare hands.  The headmaster then returned him to his seat and shouted at him again, ""Shut up, shut up"".  He then hit the second applicant over the head with the exercise book he was working from. The headmaster sat in the room a further five minutes watching and then left. On 5 October 1985 the second applicant was sitting with two other boys watching television when the headmaster walked in and said to him in a soft voice, ""Come here"".  He followed the headmaster to the headmaster's bedroom.  Once they had both entered, the headmaster shut the door and locked it with a bolt.  He then accused the second applicant of copying from another boy's Latin book, which he denied. The headmaster then said to him, ""You know what's going to happen to you, don't you?""  He replied, ""Yes, sir"", anticipating a beating. The headmaster took down the second applicant's shorts and underpants and put him across his knee and hit him six times on his bare bottom with his bare hand.  The other hand was placed on his back.  Afterwards the second applicant was crying and the headmaster said to him, ""It serves you right"".  The second applicant pulled up his underpants and shorts and the headmaster sat him on his knee and for several minutes rubbed his bottom and cuddled him.  There was a knock at the door and the headmaster opened it and spoke to two older boys for a few minutes.  After they had gone he told the second applicant, ""Forget about it; forget about it"". The second applicant left the room and later showered.  Three friends noticed the red marks on his bottom; the marks stayed for nearly a week. Within a few days after the beating the second applicant wrote to the first applicant asking her to take him away from school.  The boy was removed from the school a few weeks later, apparently by the end of the school term in December. On 12 December 1985 the second applicant made a statement to the police and there was a subsequent police investigation involving the interview of a number of pupils at the school.  The applicants wrote to the Commission on 14 July 1986 stating that they intended to lodge an application with the Commission in respect of the corporal punishment inflicted on the second applicant.  They stated they would do this as soon as the police confirmed that they would not be charging the headmaster with any offence in relation to the second applicant.  Charges were brought by the police against the headmaster for assault but none of these charges related to any incident involving the second applicant.  The Sussex Police wrote to the applicants on 24 June 1986 stating that on or about 30 April 1986 the Chief Prosecution Solicitor had decided not to proceed with charges in connection with the boy's beating.  However the police stated in this letter as follows: "" ... our Counsel may wish to make use of the evidence which we accrued in relation to <the second applicant> when presenting the case at Crown Court and indeed he may make a decision to add further counts to the indictment.  You will, therefore, appreciate that we cannot say that no prosecution or action is being brought against <the headmaster> concerning <the second applicant> until after the final hearing when he is dealt with at Chichester Crown Court."" The Headmaster's trial ended on 20 November 1986 when he was convicted on two counts of assault, neither of which related to the second applicant.  He was apparently sentenced to three months' imprisonment. COMPLAINTS 1.      The applicants allege a violation of Article 3 of the Convention in respect of the punishment of the second applicant.  They quote, inter alia, the cases of Campbell and Cosans (Eur.  Court H.R., Campbell and Cosans judgment of 25 February 1982, Series A no. 48, p.    para. 26), in which the Court observed that ""provided it is sufficiently real and immediate, a mere threat of conduct prohibited by Article 3 may itself be in conflict with that provision"".  They also cite the Tyrer case (Eur.  Court H.R., Tyrer judgment of 25 April 1978, Series A no. 26, p.   paras. 32 and 33), referring to the apparent similarities of that case with the present application, namely, the humiliation involved, the lack of medical safeguards, the institutional character and the ""aura of official procedure"", the emotional and psychological effects and the assault on both the dignity and physical integrity of the victim. The applicants contend that the respondent Government are responsible for acts which violate the Convention when they occur not only in State schools but also in independent schools as well. They quote, inter alia, the Commission's Report in the Swedish Engine Drivers' Union case (Comm.  Report 27.5.74, Eur.  Court H.R., Series B no 18, p. 41 para. 62), in which the Commission observed that a State may ""be obliged to protect individuals through appropriate measures taken against some forms of interference by other individuals, groups or organisations"". Moreover, the applicants contend that independent schooling is regulated by statute and the respondent Government ultimately have the power to permit or prevent the operation of an independent school through the registration process, and that this amounts to a broad spectrum of legal, practical and moral responsibility for independent schooling which cannot exclude the use of corporal punishment where it allegedly violates the Convention. 2.      A violation of Article 8 of the Convention is alleged in respect of the first applicant (""family life"") and the second applicant (""private and family life""). 3.      The applicants also allege that they had no effective remedy, contrary to Article 13 of the Convention. 4.      Finally they complain that as of the date of implementation of the Education (No. 2) Act 1986, sections 47 and 48, on 15 August 1987, children in independent schools will be afforded less protection than their fellow school pupils in State schools against corporal punishment, and that this difference in treatment amounts to discrimination contrary to Article 14 of the Convention. 5.      With regard to Article 26 of the Convention, the applicants' representatives draw the Commission's attention to the applicants' letter dated 14 July 1986 in which the applicants stated that they would be lodging an application once it was known categorically whether or not the headmaster would be charged by the police with any offence in relation to the second applicant.  The applicants submit that the date for the purposes of Article 26 should be 20 November 1986, the date on which the trial of the headmaster, in relation to other charges, ended.  If this date is not accepted, the applicants contend that the relevant date should be 24 June 1986, the date when the police decision not to bring charges in relation to the boy's beatings was communicated to the applicants.  Whichever date is chosen, the applicants contend that their letter of 14 July 1986 to the Commission was within six months of the final decision. THE LAW The applicants have complained that the corporal punishment of the second applicant at an independent school on 5 October 1985 constituted degrading treatment, contrary to Article 3 (Art. 3) of the Convention, a violation of their right to respect for family life ensured by Article 8 (Art. 8) of the Convention, and discrimination contrary to Article 14 (Art. 14) of the Convention, for which complaints they had no effective domestic remedies, contrary to Article 13 (Art. 13) of the Convention. However, the Commission is not required to decide whether or not the facts alleged by the applicants disclose any appearance of a violation of these provisions as Article 26 (Art. 26) of the Convention provides that the Commission ""may only deal with the matter after all domestic remedies have been exhausted, according to the generally recognised rules of international law, and within a period of six months from the date on which the final decision was taken"". English law provides a civil court remedy for assault.  Given the seriousness of the headmaster's conduct in the present case it would appear that such a remedy might have proved successful, with compensation being awarded to the applicants.  The Commission considers, therefore, that the case could be rejected for non-exhaustion of domestic remedies.  However, the applicants have claimed that it would have been ineffective (cf. No. 7907/77 Mrs.  X v. the United Kingdom, Dec. 12.7.78, D.R. 14 p. 205 at p. 210).  In that case, assuming that the applicants' contention is correct, the final decision for the purposes of the aforementioned six months' rule is the date of the incident about which complaint is made (cf.  No. 5759/72, Dec. 20.5.76, D.R. 6 p. 15).  Accordingly, in the present case the six month period runs from the date of the punishment of the second applicant, namely 5 October 1985, or, if allowance is made for his young age at the material time, a few days later, when apparently the first applicant received the second applicant's letter of complaint about the incident.  Moreover once the second applicant was withdrawn from the school before the end of December 1985 he risked no further punishment of this kind.  However, the application was lodged with the Commission on 14 July 1986, more than six months after any of these dates.  The Commission concludes, therefore, that the application must be rejected for non-observance of the six months' rule, pursuant to Articles 26 and 27 para. 3 (Art. 26, 27-3) of the Convention. For these reasons, the Commission DECLARES THE APPLICATION INADMISSIBLE. Deputy Secretary to the Commission        President of the Commission (J. RAYMOND)                         (C.A. NØRGAARD)",,

C.A. NØRGAARD, President G. SPERDUTI E. BUSUTTIL G. JÖRUNDSSON A.S. GÖZÜBÜYÜK A. WEITZEL J.-C. SOYER G. BATLINER H. VANDENBERGHE Mrs.  G.H. THUNE Sir  Basil HALL MM.  F. MARTINEZ C.L. ROZAKIS Mrs.  J. LIDDY Mr.  J. RAYMOND, Deputy Secretary to the Commission Having regard to Article 25 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms; Having regard to the application introduced on 18 February 1987 by José Ruiz Mateos against the United Kingdom and registered on 12 June 1987 under file No. 13021/87; Having regard to the report provided for in Rule 40 of the Rules of Procedure of the Commission; Having deliberated; Decides as follows: THE FACTS The applicant, José Maria Ruiz Mateos, is a citizen of Spain who was born in 1931.  He is currently resident in Madrid.  In the proceedings before the Commission he is represented by Carter Faber, solicitors, London.  The facts of the case, as submitted on behalf of the applicant, may be summarised as follows: Prior to 23 February 1983, the applicant was the President of Rumasa S.A. (""Rumasa""), a company incorporated in Spain.  He also owned 50% of the shares of this company, the remaining shares being divided equally between other members of his family.  Rumasa is the parent company of a group involving hundreds of subsidiary and associated companies, including an English company, W & H Ltd., and two Spanish banks, Banco de Jerez S.A. (""Jerez"") and Banco del Norte (""Norte"").  In 1983, the Rumasa group employed over 60,000 people and its assets have been estimated at over 500,000 million pesetas at that time.  In addition to banking, the business carried on by companies in the group included the production and shipping of wine and sherry and the management of hotels. On 23 February 1983, Rumasa and all its subsidiaries incorporated in Spain, including the two banks, were expropriated by the Spanish Government by Royal Decree.   This decree was replaced and amended by a law of 29 June 1983, which also vested control of the companies' management in the general board of state ownership.  The stated reason for the compulsory acquisition was that the Rumasa group had embarked on rash speculations and reckless expansions of credit on a scale which threatened the stability of the Spanish economy, the livelihood of workers and the savings of bank depositors. The representatives of the Spanish Government now charged with the duty of managing the Rumasa group alleged that while the applicant and his family controlled the group, sums amounting to $46 million had been improperly diverted from the two Spanish banks.  The Spanish Government accordingly caused Rumasa and the two banks to institute proceedings in the High Court, Chancery Division, in London against the applicant and companies controlled by him in order to recover assets representing the $46 million, as well as a claim for damages against the applicant (Rumasa S.A. and Others v.  Multinvest (U.K.) Ltd. and Others). During the course of these proceedings, the applicant applied for leave to amend his defence to plead that the action amounted to ""an attempt to enforce a foreign law which is penal or which otherwise ought not to be enforced"" by the court, ""and further, or alternatively, that it would be contrary to public policy to grant the relief sought or any relief."" In the applicant's submission, there were two aspects to this defence.  First, that the Spanish decree and law were confiscatory laws made in breach of his property rights through an arbitrary and discriminatory procedure and without proper compensation.  Secondly, that but for these confiscatory laws, the applicant and his family would have retained ownership of the shares and the actions would not have been brought. The question of whether the applicant could raise this defence was considered by the High Court together with the identical issue in another action brought against the applicant and others arising out of similar allegations concerning trade marks (Williams & Humbert v.  W & H, Trade Marks).  In this case the plaintiff had applied to strike out the same defence.  The present application is only concerned with the first action referred to above. On 19 December 1984 Mr.  Justice Nourse refused to allow the applicant to raise this defence inter alia on the grounds that the action did not amount to an attempt to enforce Spanish law either directly or indirectly ([1986] AC 368, pp. 375-87).  An appeal to the Court of Appeal was rejected on 3 April 1985 (loc. cit., pp. 389-414). On 12 December 1985 the House of Lords dismissed an appeal against this decision, holding that the judge had been correct to refuse to allow the applicant to amend his defence, as the consideration advanced was irrelevant to the legal questions at issue (loc. cit., pp. 425-441). The reasons for the decision of the House of Lords are set out in the judgment of Lord Templeman, who stated: ""It is ... doubtful whether the Spanish law dated 29 June 1983 can properly be described as a penal law for present purposes, but in any event the respondents are not seeking to enforce Spanish law."" He found that the object of the Spanish law at issue, namely the acquisition and control of the Spanish company and its Spanish subsidiaries, had already been wholly achieved, and the purpose of the action was therefore not the enforcement by the Spanish Government of Spanish law but the recovery of assets and damages under English private law by companies which were separate legal entities from the Government which controlled them.  Lord Templeman accordingly considered that: ""...Rumasa, Jerez and Norte ... are seeking to enforce English private law which can be invoked, subject to exceptions not here relevant, by a plaintiff of any nationality against any defendant within the jurisdiction and against any property within the jurisdiction."" Lord Templeman further reasoned that the necessary corollary of the applicant's argument was that the practical effect of the Spanish law was to release from liability outside Spain all such legal persons as were in breach of their civil obligations to any company comprised in the Rumasa group.  Such a proposition would be contrary to the principles of international law upon which were based the well-established rule that an English court will recognise, subject only to limitations for the safeguarding of human rights, a foreign law effecting a compulsory acquisition.  An English court would therefore normally decline to consider the merits of such a compulsory acquisition and would recognise the consequences of the change of title to property which has thereby come under the control of a foreign state.  Lord Templeman continued: ""...  if an application to strike out involves a prolonged and serious argument the judge should, as a general rule, decline to proceed with the argument unless he not only harbours doubts about the soundness of the pleading but, in addition, is satisfied that striking out will obviate the necessity for a trial or will substantially reduce the burden of preparing for trial or the burden of the trial itself.  In the present case, the general rule would seem to require a refusal by the judge to embark on the problems of international law involved in the present appeal, leaving those problems to be solved at the trial if they became material.  If at the trial the appellants were cleared of any impropriety in their management of the affairs of the Rumasa group, then the problems of international law would not arise.  Moreover, even if those problems did arise I do not believe that the length of time, namely seven days, occupied by the judge in deciding to strike out the pleadings would have been added to the time required to decide other issues.  But there are special circumstances which, in my view, made it right for the judge to proceed and to make the order which he made.  If the appellants' pleadings and particulars had not been struck out, the appellants would have proceeded to demand discovery before trial and to lead evidence at the trial, harrassing to the respondents and embarrassing to the court and designed to support the allegations and insinuations of oppression and bad faith on the part of the Spanish authorities which appear in the amended defences and particulars.  These allegations are irrelevant to the ... action and are inadmissible as a matter of law and comity and were rightly disposed of at the first opportunity."" The case was then returned to the Chancery Division of the High Court for trial.  In his judgment on 12 December 1986, Mr. Justice Gibson found that the assets in question had been wrongfully misapplied by the applicant in breach of his fiduciary duties.  He accordingly ordered that the applicant should pay to Jerez the sums of $53,777,106.02, Swiss Francs 9,146,561.13 and DM 13,380,647.09 by way of compensation, plus the costs of the action. The applicant was advised by leading counsel that as a result of the above ruling of the House of Lords he had no realistic prospect of success in an appeal against this decision. COMPLAINTS The applicant complains that he was prevented by United Kingdom law from arguing, as a defence to the claim brought against him in the English courts, that the action would not have been brought but for the Spanish expropriation law, and that the said law was penal and confiscatory in nature and was made in breach of his fundamental rights, including the rights protected under the Convention and Protocol No. 1 thereto. Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 The applicant complains that the decision of Mr.  Justice Gibson of 12 December 1986 deprived him of his possessions in a manner contrary to Article 1 of Protocol No. 1. In this connection, the applicant submits first that this decision enforced laws deemed necessary to control the use of property within the meaning of the second paragraph of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1. In denying him the opportunity to raise the said defence, the applicant argues that United Kingdom law failed to draw a fair balance between his own interests and those of the community as a whole, as required by the Convention, and more specifically, that it failed to provide a procedure compatible with Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 in denying him a reasonable opportunity of putting his case as to why he should not be deprived of his property.  In this respect, the applicant invokes the Agosi case (Eur.  Court H.R., Agosi judgment of 24 October 1986, Series A no. 108, p. 17 at paras. 54-55) as authority for the proposition that all the relevant circumstances should be taken into account in such a determination, and submits in consequence that the reasons given by the House of Lords for refusing to allow him to raise his defence in the English courts are no answer to the complaint under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1.  In the submission of the applicant, the Spanish expropriation law was not only a relevant circumstance for the action in the English courts, but was central to its existence and outcome. Articles 6, 13 and 14 of the Convention The applicant complains further that in the determination of his civil rights and obligations in respect of substantial sums of money, he was prevented from raising before the courts the substance of his defence and that he was therefore denied a fair hearing, contrary to Article 6 para. 1 of the Convention. The applicant also complains that he had no domestic remedy in the United Kingdom for his complaint that United Kingdom law wrongly deprived him of his property and denied him a fair hearing, contrary to Article 13 of the Convention.  In particular, the House of Lords was unable, as a matter of domestic law, to apply to the case of the applicant the standards and principles set down in the Convention and in Protocol No. 1. In the alternative, the applicant complains that the United Kingdom acted in breach of Article 13 by failing to provide him with an opportunity of arguing that the Spanish expropriation law was in breach of the Convention and of Protocol No. 1. Finally, the applicant complains that he is the victim of discrimination in that other persons whose property is the subject of litigation in the United Kingdom are able to present defences arguing that for reasons of public policy no relief should be granted to the plaintiff.  In this connection, the applicant invokes Article 14 in conjunction with Articles 6 and 13 of the Convention and with Article 1 of Protocol No. 1. THE LAW 1.      The applicant has complained that the proceedings before the Chancery Division of the High Court which led to the decision of Mr.  Justice Gibson on 12 December 1986 amounted to a violation of his rights under the Convention and, in particular, Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (P1-1).  The applicant has complained that the High Court was prevented by United Kingdom law from considering his defence to the action brought against him by Rumasa, Jerez and Norte and such action would not have been brought but for the Spanish expropriation law, and that the said law was penal and confiscatory in nature and was made in breach of his fundamental rights. Article 26 (Art. 26) of the Convention The Commission notes that in respect of the original refusal of the High Court, on 19 December 1984, to consider the above defence, the applicant subsequently appealed without success to the Court of Appeal.  He appealed again to the House of Lords which finally dismissed the issue for purposes of domestic law on 12 December 1985. It was not until one year later, on 12 December 1986, that judgment was given against the applicant in the main action taken against him by the Spanish companies.  On the basis of advice then given to him by counsel, the applicant did not appeal against that decision. Article 26 (Art. 26) of the Convention provides as follows: ""The Commission may only deal with the matter after all domestic remedies have been exhausted, according to the generally recognised rules of international law, and within a period of six months from the date on which the final decision was taken."" The Commission is of the opinion that it is not necessary in the present case to consider whether the applicant has complied with the six months rule and has exhausted all available domestic remedies since the applicant's complaints fall, in any event, to be rejected as inadmissible for the reasons developed below. 2.       Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (P1-1) The applicant has complained first that the decision of Mr. Justice Gibson on 12 December 1986 deprived him of his possessions in a manner contrary to Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (P1-1),  which provides as follows: ""Every natural or legal person is entitled to the peaceful enjoyment of his possessions.  No one shall be deprived of his possessions except in the public interest and subject to the conditions provided for by law and by the general principles of international law. The preceding provisions shall not, however, in any way impair the right of a State to enforce such laws as it deems necessary to control the use of property in accordance with the general interest or to secure the payment of taxes or other contributions or penalties."" The applicant has submitted that he was deprived of his possessions contrary to the second sentence of this provision.  In this connection he complains that he was denied a reasonable opportunity of putting his case as to why he should not be deprived of his property. The Commission recalls that the deprivation of property referred to in the second sentence of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (P1-1) is primarily concerned with the formal expropriation of assets for public purposes, and not with the regulation of rights between persons under private law unless state responsibility is in some way involved in affecting their exercise (e.g.  Nos. 8588/79 and 8589/79, Bramelid and Malmström v.  Sweden, Dec. 12.10.82, D.R. 29 p. 64). In the present case, it is clear that the United Kingdom has not directly deprived the applicant of his possessions or otherwise expropriated his property.  Nor can it be said that the United Kingdom was enforcing ""such laws as it deems necessary to control the use of property"" within the meaning of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (P1-1).  The order against the applicant was rather made by the Chancery Division of the High Court in the exercise of its jurisdiction over a private law dispute between the applicant on the one hand and three companies which he had formerly controlled on the other.  The dispute directly concerned an alleged breach on the part of the applicant of his fiduciary obligations towards those companies, in improperly diverting money from them.  In essence the High Court in its decision of 12 December 1986 decided that the applicant had no entitlement to the monies so diverted and that they should be returned with interest to the plaintiff companies. The Commission finds that the mere fact that a judicial authority provided a forum for the determination of such a private law dispute does not give rise to an interference by the State with property rights under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (P1-1) (see in this context No. 10000/82, Dec. 4.7.83, D.R. 33 p. 247;  No. 11949/86, Dec. 1.12.86, to be published in D.R.) However, the applicant contends that a State is subject to a positive obligation under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (P1-1) to protect the property rights of an individual in the context of a dispute with another private individual to the extent necessary to ensure that in the determination of that dispute all relevant arguments will be fully considered by the courts.  In this connection, the applicant has invoked the finding of the European Court of Human Rights in the Agosi judgment of 24 October 1986 to the effect that ""... although the second paragraph of Aricle 1 [of Protocol No. 1] (P1-1) contains no explicit procedural requirements, the court must consider ... whether the procedures in question afforded the applicant ... a reasonable opportunity of putting its case to the responsible authorities"" (loc. cit., p. 19, para. 55). The Commission recalls that the Agosi case concerned a direct control of the applicant company's property by the respondent State in purported pursuance of the aims laid down in the second paragaraph of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (P1-1).  In the present case, however, there has been neither a deprivation of the applicant's property nor a control of the use of property by the respondent State within the meaning of that provision.  Accordingly, the considerations taken into account by the Court in the Agosi case relating to the striking of a fair balance between the interests of the individual and the interests of the State do not arise in the present case. Having regard to the above, the Commission finds that Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (P1-1) cannot be interpreted so as to require the United Kingdom courts to examine the applicant's claim that the Spanish law providing for the acquisition of Rumasa was penal and confiscatory. It follows that the proceedings in question do not amount to an interference with the applicant's property rights as guaranteed by this provision and that this complaint must be dismissed as manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 27 para. 2 (Art. 27-2) of the Convention. 3.      Article 6 para. 1 (Art. 6-1) of the Convention The applicant has also complained that as a result of the ruling that the said defence could not be invoked, he was denied a fair hearing in the action brought against him by the Spanish companies, contrary to Article 6 para. 1 (Art. 6-1) of the Convention. With regard to the proceedings of which the applicant complains, the Commission recalls that, in accordance with Article 19 (Art. 19) of the Convention, its only task is to ensure the observance of the obligations undertaken by the Parties in the Convention.  In particular, it is not competent to deal with a complaint alleging that errors of law or fact have been committed by domestic courts, except where it considers that such errors might have involved a possible violation of any of the rights and freedoms set out in the Convention. The Commission refers, on this point, to its constant case-law (see e.g.  No. 458/59, Dec. 29.3.60, Yearbook 3 pp. 222, 236;  No. 5258/71, Dec. 8.2.73, Collection 43 pp. 71, 77;  No. 7987/77, Dec. 13.12.79, D.R. 18 pp. 31, 45). The Commission notes in this connection that the question as to whether the applicant's said defence could be raised was extensively examined by the courts.  In addition to being considered in a lengthy hearing before the High Court in December 1984, the issue was the subject of two separate hearings on appeal before the Court of Appeal and the House of Lords.  The decision then reached as a matter of domestic law was that the defence sought to be raised was irrelevant to the proceedings in question and that it had been disposed of correctly by the trial judge. Moreover, the applicant had the assistance of counsel in the presentation of his defence before the High Court and in the appeal proceedings.  There is nothing in his submissions which suggests that his counsel, or the applicant in person, was prevented from making full submissions on the question of the relevance of the said defence to the proceedings taken against him.  Nor is there any other indication of unfairness in the proceedings as a whole such as to raise an issue under Article 6 para. 1 (Art. 6-1) of the Convention. It follows that this part of the applicant's complaint must also be rejected as manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 27 para. 2 (Art. 27-2) of the Convention. 4.      Article 13 (Art. 13) of the Convention The applicant has complained firstly that the failure of United Kingdom law to provide him with an opportunity of raising the said defence amounted to a breach of Article 13 (Art. 13) of the Convention. Article 13 (Art. 13) states as follows: ""Everyone whose rights and freedoms as set forth in this Convention are violated shall have an effective remedy before a national authority notwithstanding that the violation has been committed by persons acting in an official capacity."" The Commission recalls that it is well established that where the right claimed is of a civil character, the guarantees of Article 13 (Art. 13) are superseded by the more stringent requirements of Article 6 para. 1 (Art. 6-1) of the Convention (e.g.  No. 10358/83, Dec. 15.12.83, D.R. 37 p. 142).  It follows that no separate issue arises under Article 13 (Art. 13) in respect of this aspect of the applicant's complaint. The applicant has argued in the alternative that the United Kingdom is in breach of Article 13 (Art. 13) in failing to provide a remedy under United Kingdom law for his complaints under Article 6 (Art. 6) of the Convention and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (P1-1). The Commission recalls that for Article 13 (Art. 13) to apply the claim that a provision of the Convention has been breached must be an ""arguable"" one (see Eur.  Court H.R., Boyle and Rice judgment of 27 April 1988, Series A no. 131, paras. 52-55).  The Commission notes that it has rejected the applicant's complaint under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (P1-1) on the basis that the judicial determination before the courts of the United Kingdom of the dispute between the applicant and Rumasa, Jerez and Norte does not interfere with the applicant's property rights.  It also recalls that it has concluded that the court proceedings were fair within the meaning of Article 6 para. 1 (Art. 6-1) of the Convention.   Against this background the Commission does not consider that the applicant's complaints under these provisions can be described as ""arguable"" ones for the purpose of this provision. It follows that the above complaint under Article 13 (Art. 13) must be rejected as incompatible ratione materiae with the provisions of the Convention within the meaning of Article 27 para. 2 (Art. 27-2) of the Convention. 5.      Article 14 (Art. 14) of the Convention The applicant has also complained that he was subject to discrimination in that other persons or companies whose property is the subject of litigation in the United Kingdom are able to present similar defences to that which the applicant sought to raise in relation to the Spanish expropriation law. However, the applicant has not shown that persons or companies in a comparable situation to that obtaining in his case would be treated differently in the determination of a similar dispute under United Kingdom law. The Commission therefore finds that the applicant has not substantiated his complaint of discrimination contrary to Article 14 (Art. 14) of the Convention. It follows that this part of the application must also be rejected as manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 27 para. 2 (Art. 27-2) of the Convention.

RAYMOND, Deputy Secretary to the Commission Having regard to Article 25 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms; Having regard to the application introduced on 23 September 1987 by Frank LANG against the United Kingdom and registered on 6 January 1988 under file No. 13488/88; Having regard to the report provided for in Rule 40 of the Rules of Procedure of the Commission; Having deliberated; Decides as follows: THE FACTS The applicant is a British citizen born in 1965 and resident in Glasgow.  He is represented by Mr.  John Carroll, a solicitor practising in Glasgow.  The facts as submitted by the applicant may be summarised as follows. The applicant was tried at Kilmarnock Sheriff Court on a charge of stealing £1,800.  The applicant, who had been granted legal aid, was represented by a solicitor.  The applicant was found guilty on 10 December 1986 and sentenced to six months imprisonment.  The applicant appealed by way of case stated on grounds, inter alia, that the Sheriff erred in finding sufficient evidence for there to be a case to answer, that the Sheriff held second best evidence to be admissible and to be preferred to best evidence and that the Sheriff erred as to the facts of the case, in particular as to the evidence of a police witness and a video tape. The applicant was granted an interim appeal certificate for the purpose of legal aid and certain preliminary work was carried out.  However, his application for a full certificate which was supported by his solicitor's written opinion that the grounds of appeal were substantial was refused by a letter dated 11 May 1987. Following the refusal of legal aid, the applicant's solicitor sought further advice from counsel, who, however, in opinions dated June and 5 September 1987, concluded that the appeal had no prospects of success.  Without funds, the applicant was obliged to plead his own case before the High Court, his solicitors having provided him with notes and relevant documents. The applicant's appeal was upheld by the court on 22 September 1987 and his conviction was quashed.  The reasons given by the court were stated briefly as follows: ""In this appeal at the instance of Frank Lang in view of the concessions made by the Advocate Depute and the attitude which he has very properly taken up, we find it unnecessary to answer the three questions in the case and we shall simply quash the conviction."" Following a request for information concerning this decision dated 4 March 1988, the Government stated that information had been received by the Crown Authorities and defence which suggested that one of the police officers was mistaken in his identification of the applicant from the video recording.  This information was not fully canvassed at the trial and was not put to the police officer in cross-examination.  On full consideration of the matter before the appeal court, it was apparent that there was at least a risk that part of the identification evidence was unsound.  Accordingly, it was conceded by the Crown that the conviction should be quashed. By a letter dated 13 May 1988, in reply to the Government's statement, the applicant's solicitor submitted that during the trial one of the police officers had pointed to a person on the video film as being the applicant, but who was in fact a bank employee.  The applicant's solicitor states that it would have been professional negligence on the part of the solicitor defending the applicant to have pointed this out to the police officer or to suggest that he should point to his client instead.  The matter was obvious to the defence and was simply left as it was to demonstrate the unreliability of the identification. As a result of the work carried out by his solicitors on his behalf in respect of preparing his appeal, the applicant is now liable to an account of £397,54, which he is unable to pay without grave financial hardship. COMPLAINTS The applicant complains that he was denied his basic human rights in that though he had insufficient funds to meet the cost of legal representation, he was denied free legal assistance.  Although his appeal was successful, he is unable to secure costs from the courts and accordingly is liable to an account in respect of the legal assistance, which was given. The applicant invokes Article 6 para. 1 and Article 6 para. 3 (c) of the Convention. THE LAW The applicant complains that he was denied free legal assistance for his appeal contrary to Article 6 para. 3 (c) (Art. 6-3-c) of the Convention, which provides as follows: ""Everyone charged with a criminal offence has the following minimum rights: ... (c) to defend himself in person or through legal assistance of his own choosing or, if he has not sufficient means to pay for legal assistance, to be given it free when the interests of justice so require;"" The Commission recalls that the evaluation of the requirements of justice under Article 6 para. 3 (c) (Art. 6-3-c) of the Convention lies in the first place with the domestic authorities.  The Commission notes the applicant was granted legal aid for his trial and an interim certificate for the purposes of his appeal.  An application for full legal aid was submitted to the Scottish Legal Aid Board, supported by his solicitor's opinion but was refused by letter dated 11 May 1987. There is no indication that in refusing legal aid, the Scottish Legal Aid Board acted on arbitrary grounds.  The Commission recalls that counsel instructed by the applicant's solicitor was of the opinion that the appeal stood no prospects of success.  The Commission further notes that the subsequent quashing of the conviction was the result of a concession of the Advocate Depute as to the possible unsoundness of part of the identification evidence and that the Court of Appeal considered it unnecessary to go on to deal with the applicant's three points of appeal. In these circumstances, the Commission concludes that it has not been shown in the present case that the interests of justice within the meaning of Article 6 para. 3 (c) (Art. 6-3-c) required a grant of free legal assistance to the applicant for the appeal proceedings.  It follows that this application is manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 27 para. 2 (Art. 27-2) of the Convention. For these reasons, the Commission DECLARES THE APPLICATION INADMISSIBLE. Deputy Secretary to the Commission         President of the Commission (J. RAYMOND)                          (C.A.

RAYMOND, Deputy Secretary to the Commission Having regard to Article 25 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms; Having regard to the application introduced on 5 October 1984 by Jacobus J.P. KEIJSPER against the Netherlands and registered on 19 March 1986 under file No. 12055/86; Having regard to the report provided for in Rule 40 of the Rules of Procedure of the Commission; Having deliberated; Decides as follows: THE FACTS The applicant, who is a Dutch citizen, was born on 25 February 1933 and is presently residing in Breda, the Netherlands. In the proceedings before the Commission he is represented by Mr.  F.R. van der Laken, a lawyer practising in Breda. On 5 April 1984 the Regional Court of 's-Hertogenbosch found the applicant guilty of co-operating in drug-trafficking from the Netherlands to the United Kingdom, which constitutes a crime within the meaning of the Dutch Narcotics Act.  The applicant was sentenced to 18 months imprisonment. On the same day, the applicant lodged an appeal with the Court of Appeal in 's-Hertogenbosch. In the meantime, the applicant's detention on remand, which had started at some date before the Regional Court's judgment, continued.  According to Section 557 of the Code of Penal Procedure, the execution of a judgment is suspended until after an ordinary remedy instituted against it has been withdrawn or decided upon.  The applicant's continued detention after his conviction on 5 April 1984 was, under Dutch law,  considered as detention on remand.  After that date, the periodical control of the lawfulness of the continued detention on remand passed from the Regional Court to the Court of Appeal. On 24 April, 22 May, 15 June, 24 July and 21 August 1984, the Court of Appeal, upon requests by the Attorney-General, ordered the prolongation of the applicant's detention.  At the hearings held on the occasion of the requests by the Attorney-General, the applicant's lawyer pleaded that his client was not guilty and that the suspicion against his client was insufficient to justify a continuation of the detention.  He also objected to the fact that the applicant's case-file, including the judgment of the Regional Court and the procès-verbal of the hearing before that court, was not, at the time of the first three orders, in the possession of the Court of Appeal or of the Attorney-General.  During the hearing on 15 June 1984, the Attorney-General declared that the applicant's case-file had been with the registry of the Court of Appeal at least once and that copies were made of the most important testimonies, which show sufficient grounds for continuation of the detention.  He indicated, in particular, that the applicant already had a criminal record and that there existed a fear of repetition, having regard to the organised nature of the crime of which he was suspected. On 25 June 1984, copies of the Regional Court's judgment of 5 April 1984 were sent to the registry of the Court of Appeal. According to the applicant, it is doubtful whether an integral text of the judgment was at all in written form before its submission to the registry of the Court of Appeal. On 9 October 1984, the Court of Appeal upheld the judgment of the Regional Court.  On 4 June 1985, Supreme Court quashed this decision on the ground that the Court of Appeal had wrongly based its judgment on testimony which was put into doubt by a later statement of the witness concerned. The case was referred to the Arnhem Court of Appeal which acquitted the applicant on 21 November 1986. On 10 July 1987, the Arnhem Court of Appeal granted the applicant 50,000 Dutch guilders damages in respect of the detention on remand he has suffered. COMPLAINTS The applicant complains that the prolongation of his detention on remand on 24 April, 22 May and 15 June 1984 amounts to a violation of Article 5 paras. 3 and 4 and Article 6 para. 1 of the Convention, since the Court of Appeal took its decisions without having recourse to the case-file. He alleges that the relevant proceedings before the Court of Appeal were not fair within the meaning of Article 6 of the Convention, because the court was not able to form an opinion on the validity of the applicant's arguments for termination of the detention.  For the same reason, the applicant alleges that Article 5 para. 3 of the Convention was violated, since a decision to release pending trial presupposes an assessment of the arguments for and against on the part of the judge.  Nor can there be, according to the applicant, an acceptable decision on the lawfulness of the detention as envisaged in Article 5 para. 4 of the Convention when the competent court does not possess the case-file. THE LAW 1.      The applicant has alleged that the prolongation of his detention on remand, ordered by the Court of Appeal on 24 April, 22 May and 15 June 1984 constitutes a violation of Article 5 para. 3 (Art. 5-3) of the Convention on account of the fact that the orders were given without the Court having recourse to the case-file concerning the applicant. The Commission first notes that the decision complained of concerned the applicant's detention on remand after his conviction in first instance by the Regional Court on 5 April 1984. It follows from the case-law of the Commission and the European Court of Human Rights that, for the purposes of the Convention, such a detention on remand after conviction while an appeal is pending should be considered as detention ""after conviction"" within the meaning of Article 5 para. 1 (a) (Art. 5-1-a) of the Convention, even if detention continues to be considered as detention on remand under domestic law (Eur. Court H.R., Wemhoff judgment of 27 June 1968, Series A no. 7, p. 23-24, para. 9;  No. 8555/79, Dec. 4.12.79, D.R. 20 p. 199; No. 9132/80, Dec. 16.12.82, D.R. 31 p. 154). In the present case, therefore, the applicant's detention after his conviction on 5 April 1984 cannot be regarded as detention under Article 5 para. 1 (c) (Art. 5-1-c) of the Convention.  It follows that Article 5 para. 3 (Art. 5-3) does not apply to that period of detention.  This complaint must therefore be rejected as incompatible ratione materiae with the provisions of the Convention within the meaning of Article 27 para. 2 (Art. 27-2) of the Convention. 2.      The applicant has further complained that Article 5 para. 4 (Art. 5-4) of the Convention was violated in that the Court of Appeal could not adequately decide upon the lawfulness of his detention since it did not have recourse to the case-file. However, even assuming that Article 5 para. 4 (Art. 5-4) of the Convention is applicable to the Court of Appeal's decisions to prolong the applicant's detention, the Commission finds that there is no appearance of a violation of this provision since it is clear that, for the purposes of Article 5 para. 4 (Art. 5-4), the requisite judicial control was incorporated in the applicant's original conviction by the Regional Court (cf. inter alia, Eur.  Court H.R., De Wilde, Ooms and Versyp judgment of 18 June 1971, Series A no. 12, p. 40, para. 76). It follows that this part of the application must be rejected as manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 27 para. 2 (Art. 27-2) of the Convention. 3.      The applicant has also complained that the Court of Appeal could not have due regard to his arguments for the termination of his detention since it lacked knowledge of the relevant documents.  He has alleged that the proceedings concerned were not fair within the meaning of Article 6 (Art. 6) of the Convention. However, the Commission notes that the proceedings complained of concerned prolongations of the applicant's detention and that they did not involve a determination of a criminal charge within the meaning of Article 6 para. 1 (Art. 6-1) of the Convention (cf. mutatis mutandis, No. 6541/74, Dec. 18.12.74, D.R. 1 p. 82). It follows that the proceedings complained of fall outside the scope of Article 6 para. 1 (Art. 6-1) and that, therefore, this part of the application is also incompatible ratione materiae with the provisions of the Convention within the meaning of Article 27 para. 2 (Art. 27-2) of the Convention.

He is represented in the proceedings before the Commission by David Gray & Co., Solicitors, Newcastle-upon-Tyne. The application arises out of a decision by the Secretary of State to deport the applicant to Iran.  The facts of the case, which are not in dispute between the parties unless otherwise indicated, may be summarised as follows: The applicant was admitted to the United Kingdom as a visitor and subsequently a student in 1977.  Following the Iranian revolution in 1979 he became a supporter of the Peoples Mojahedin and claims that because of this the Iranian authorities prevented funds being sent to him in England to continue his studies.  The Mojahedin supported the overthrow of the Shah but broke with the Khomeini régime in 1981 and has since urged the overthrow of the Iranian Government. Subsequently an extension of leave to remain in the United Kingdom was refused.  An appeal to the Adjudicator against this refusal was also refused as was an application for leave to appeal to the Immigration Appeal Tribunal on 14 November 1980.  As from this date the applicant became an overstayer. In 1982 he was sentenced to eight months' imprisonment with a recommendation for deportation for four offences of dishonesty.  In May 1983 he was also sentenced to five years imprisonment for a drugs offence and again recommended for deportation.  The drug (28 grammes of heroin) had been sent to another Iranian at a house where the applicant was living and although it was accepted by the prosecution that he was in no way involved with the act of importation he admitted that following receipt he became aware of the contents and pleaded guilty to the offence of ""being knowingly concerned in the fraudulent evasion of the prohibition on importation of a class A controlled drug (heroin)"". He appealed against sentence to the Court of Appeal which reduced his sentence to three years.  The applicant claims that the trial judge whilst recommending deportation accepted his fears of returning to Iran and indicated that he would not have to return to that country. The applicant was, in the meantime, interviewed in connection with his application for asylum in 1982 but this was subsequently refused. A formal deportation order was made against him on 31 October 1984 prior to the completion of his sentence.  No appeal lies against the merits of the deportation order.  The applicant was, however, able to appeal under Section 17 of the Immigration Act 1971 to an Adjudicator against the destination of Iran.  This appeal was rejected in May 1985 since the applicant was unable to find another country willing to accept him.  An appeal to the Immigration Appeal Tribunal against this decision was also unsuccessful.  He was released from custody in May 1985 on bail.  Since his release he has continued his previous political activities by way of distribution of leaflets, attending meetings and political demonstrations organised by the People's Mojahedin. Further applications for asylum were rejected by the Secretary of State in November 1984 and, after a Member of Parliament had intervened on the applicant's behalf, in September 1985. He was arrested on 1 July 1986 under the original deportation order and released on 21 July 1986 pending further consideration of his case by the Home Office.  The application for asylum was reconsidered and the applicant was interviewed on 1 August 1986.  The Home Secretary subsequently informed the applicant's solicitors in a letter dated 26 November 1986 of his decision to maintain the refusal to grant the asylum application. On 15 July 1988 the applicant's solicitor wrote to the Home Office requesting that the applicant be granted exceptional leave to remain in the United Kingdom.  The Home Office replied on 25 August 1988 stating that his application for asylum had been reconsidered but that in view of the applicant's criminal record and immigration history exceptional leave to remain was not justified. Relevant domestic law and practice The United Kingdom is a party to the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees and the 1967 Protocol to the Convention. This is reflected for deportation purposes in the Statement of Changes in the Immigration Rules (HC 169) at paragraphs 153 and 165. Paragraph 153 reads: ""Refugees Where a person is a refugee full account is to be taken of the provisions of the Convention and Protocol relating to the Status of Refugees.  Nothing in these rules is to be construed as requiring action contrary to the United Kingdom's obligations under these instruments."" Paragraph 165 reads: ""Asylum In accordance with the provisions of the Convention and Protocol relating to the Status of Refugees, a deportation order will not be made against a person if the only country to which he can be removed is one to which he is unwilling to go owing to well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular group or political opinion."" Article 1.A(2) of the 1951 Convention, as amended by the 1967 Protocol, reads, so far as is relevant: ""... the term 'refugee' shall apply to any person who: (2)  owing to a well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion, is outside the country of his nationality and is unable or, owing to such fear, is unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that country ..."" Article 33 para. 1 of the Convention provides: ""No contracting state shall expel or return a refugee in any manner whatsoever to the frontiers of territories where his life or freedom would be threatened on account of his race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion."" Article 33 (2) of the Convention reads, so far as is relevant: ""2.  The benefit of the present provision [Prohibition of Expulsion or Return (Refoulement)] may not, however, be claimed by a refugee ... who, having been convicted by a final judgment of a particularly serious crime, constitutes a danger to the community of that country."" The power to give or vary leave to remain in the United Kingdom is exercised by the Secretary of State in accordance with section 4(1) of the Immigration Act 1971.  The application for asylum in this case was treated as an application for leave to remain.  The Secretary of State's power is discussed by the House of Lords in the case of R. v.  Home Secretary, ex parte Bugdaycay and Others [1987] 2 WLR 606.  Lord Bridge held that challenge in the courts of the Home Secretary's exercise of discretion was restricted to an investigation of whether the Home Secretary had left out of account a factor that should have been taken into account or took into account a factor he should have ignored, or whether the decision is such that no authority properly directing itself on the relevant law and acting reasonably could have reached it (the ""Wednesbury principles"", based on Associated Provincial Picture Houses Ltd. v.  Wednesbury Corporation [1948] 1 KB 223).  Challenge would be by way of judicial review. The extent and effect of judicial review was demonstrated in that case when it was held that the Home Secretary had failed to appreciate a factor which he should have specifically dealt with.  This failure was held to be fatal to the refusal of asylum.  Lord Bridge, while acknowledging the limitations of Wednesbury principles, explained that the courts will apply them extremely strictly against the Home Secretary when a refusal of asylum is under review: ""Within those limitations the court must, I think, be entitled to subject an administrative decision to the more rigorous examination to ensure that it is in no way flawed, according to the gravity of the issue which the decision determines. The most fundamental of all human rights is the individual's right to life and when an administrative decision under challenge is said to be one which may put the applicant's life at risk, the basis of the decision must surely call for the most anxious scrutiny"". Lord Templeman added: ""In my opinion where the result of a flawed decision may imperil life or liberty a special responsibility lies on the court in the examination of the decision-making process."" The order of the Secretary of State for the removal of the applicant to Kenya was accordingly quashed. A court granting leave to an applicant to apply for judicial reiew is empowered to direct that the decision which is subject to review should be stayed until the court has made its decision. COMPLAINTS The applicant complains that if he is sent back to Iran he runs a strong risk of being executed in view of the attitude taken by the Iranian authorities to persons involved in drug offences.  He claims that he has also produced substantial evidence to the Home Office of his involvement in political activities in the United Kingdom against the Iranian regime, including participation in meetings and public demonstrations.  He believes that his identity is well known to the Iranian authorities and accordingly he fears persecution as a result of those activities were he to return to Iran. He invokes Article 3 of the Convention. He further complains with reference to Application No. 9856/82 (Kandiah v. the United Kingdom, Dec. 14.5.87 to be published in D.R.) that he has not had the opportunity to have his deportation and fear of persecution judicially considered.  He adopts for purposes of his application the arguments that have been developed by the applicant in respect of Article 13 in the Kandiah case. PROCEEDINGS BEFORE THE COMMISSION The application was introduced on the 11 July 1986 and registered on the 16 July 1986.  The application was considered by the Commission on the 18 July 1986 when it was decided to request information from the respondent Government pursuant to Rule 42 (2)(a) of the Rules of Procedure. The respondent Government undertook by letter dated 23 July 1986 not to remove the applicant from the United Kingdom without informing the Commission in advance. After an extension of the time-limit which had been granted the information was submitted on the 12 November 1986 and communicated to the applicant's legal advisors for their comments.  These were received on 29 December 1986. The Commission further considered the application on 14 July 1987 and decided to communicate it to the respondent Government for observations on the admissibility and merits of the complaints.  These observations were submitted on 28 October 1987. The applicant's observations in reply were forwarded on 3 February 1988. The Commission next considered the application on 12 May 1988 and decided to invite the parties to a hearing on the admissibility and merits of the application insofar as it raised issues under Articles 3 and 13 of the Convention. The applicant was subsequently granted legal aid by the President of the Commission on 19 August 1988. The hearing before the Commission was held on 7 September 1988.  The parties were represented as follows: -   for the respondent Government:             Mr.  M. C. Wood, Foreign and Commonwealth Office, Agent Mr.  M. Baker,   Counsel Mr.  J. Eadie,   Counsel Mr.  S. Bramley, Home Office, Adviser Mr.  S. Spence,  Home Office, Adviser -   for the applicant:      Mr.  D. Gray, solicitor SUBMISSIONS OF THE PARTIES Respondent Government AS TO FACT A.      Fear of Execution in Iran The applicant was interviewed at the Home Office in respect of his fears of persecution on the 19 August 1986.  At his interview he made it clear that he did not fear execution in Iran because of his conviction for drug smuggling but rather because of his political activities with the Mojahedin in the United Kingdom.  He stated that he believed his conviction had been reported in the local press in Manchester and that it would probably have been noted by the Iranian Consulate in Manchester.   The Government accept that it is possible that the Iranian authorities are aware of his conviction for smuggling drugs.  However, they are not aware of any evidence to suggest that any Iranian who has been convicted of a drugs offence abroad has ever been executed in Iran on his return on the strength of that conviction. B.      The extent of the applicant's political activities when resident in the United Kingdom. The applicant was not politically active in Iran.  His political activities have all taken place in the United Kingdom. After the Iranian revolution in 1979 he became a supporter of the Mojahedin.  He read their literature and heard tapes of speeches by their leader Majoudrajavi.  He stated that he had been on five or six major demonstrations between 1979 and 1982.  During this period he attended pickets, collected money on behalf of the Mojahedin and assisted in setting up their meetings.  He did not organise these meetings or speak at them. .PA:12268/87 Between 1983 - 84 there was no political activity because of his prison sentence.  Since being released from prison he has been involved in the Muslim students' society (the student wing of the Mojahedin) at Middlesborough Polytechnic.  He has brought videos and tapes of speeches to meetings but he is not a member of the Mojahedin because they have no members as such outside Iran - only supporters. The applicant holds no official position in the Muslim students' society.  He appears not to have spoken at meetings.  He is, however, knowledgable about the beliefs and organisation of the Mojahedin. Article 26 - Domestic remedies The Government wrote to the applicant's solicitor on 26 November 1986 and 25 August 1985, refusing asylum.  It is possible to apply for leave to move for judicial review within three months of the latest decision or out of time provided he can explain the earlier delay. Bugdaycay (loc. cit.) and subsequent cases (Sivakumaran and Others, [1985] 1 ALL ER 193;  Selladurai Jeyakumaran, decision of the Divisional Court, 28 June 1985;  Veraj Mendis, decision of the Court of Appeal, June 1988; Yemoh, decision of the Divisional Court, July 1988) demonstrate that, although the courts are not prepared to dispute a decision by the Secretary of State that a deportee will not be persecuted in a given country provided the decision has been properly taken, the courts are prepared to quash a refusal of asylum.  They will do so if there is any suggestion that all factors urged on behalf of the applicant have not been genuinely and seriously considered. The courts are not in a position to override the decision which rests upon an informed estimation of the political affairs of a foreign country.  However, if as in Bugdaycay, the Home Secretary fails to pay any, or sufficient, attention to a salient fact about the country to which an intended deportee is to be sent, the courts will act. Similarly, in Yemoh, the Secretary of State refused asylum to a Ghanaian whose account of arbitrary arrest and maltreament he did not accept as credible because of a lack of objective medical evidence to support it and because of the ease with which the victim had been allowed to leave his native country.  After a close examination of these reasons, Mr.  Justice Hutchison decided that they did not justify the conclusion which the Secretary of State had reached and quashed the decision. It might be argued that the 1951 Convention is qualified by Article 33 (2) which disapplied the Convention's protection from those, like the applicant, whom the Government deemed a serious danger to society and to have been convicted of serious crime.  Article 3 of the European Convention is not so qualified.  However, it is clear that the courts would consider the applicant's arguments on this point, provided he was able to satisfy them that he had a genuinely well founded fear of persecution in Iran. The applicant justifies his omission to seek judicial review by claiming that domestic law only permits a challenge to the decision-making process and not to the merits of the decision.  The Government, however, point out that the phrase ""the merits of the decision"" means no more than that element of the decision which remains when all irrelevant factors have been set to one side, and all relevant factors have been fully, properly, and fairly taken into account. 12268/87 Furthermore, it would  be open to the applicant to raise many of the points that he raises before the Commission in judicial review proceedings.  For example he could raise (1) the fact that he has committed no criminal offence and has not been involved in drug abuse since his release from prison;  (2) his claim that the Government ought to have interviewed his parents about his fears of perscution when they came to the United Kingdom;  (3) his claim that in view of the evidence supporting his fear of persecution the Secretary of State should have found it likely that the applicant would be exposed to inhuman or degrading treatment if returned to Iran. Finally the Government point out that a court granting leave to an applicant to apply for judicial review is empowered to direct that the decision which is subject to review should be stayed until the court has finally made its decision. Article 3 of the Convention The Government reserve their position on the principle that deportation may in exceptional circumstances raise an issue under Article 3.  They contend that the Commission has never formulated a satisfactory rationale for this principle nor has it ever been scrutinised by the Court. The Government treat the applicant's complaint under Article 3 as a claim that his case involves exceptional circumstances that his deportation to Iran would constitute inhuman treatment.  In this regard the Government point out that the applicant has had various applications for asylum carefully considered by the Home Secretary and rejected in June 1982, in October 1984, September 1985 and August 1986.  The conclusion reached after his interview in August 1986 was that, quite apart from the question of menace posed by the applicant to the community (although this was taken into account), the applicant had failed to establish a well founded fear of persecution or that he would suffer inhuman treatment if he were returned to Iran. It is clear that any fear that the applicant has of deportation to Iran is based on political persecution.  He has made it clear at his interview that he was not concerned about his drugs conviction.  The applicant's solicitor has accepted in a letter to the Commission dated 16 December 1986 that there is no ""no evidence of persons convicted outside Iran of drugs offences being executed on their return to Iran"". In this respect the Government do not accept that there is any objective evidence which establishes that the Iranian authorities would actively be concerned about a drugs offence committed outside their jurisdiction or that they would be likely to punish for a second time a person who had already been convicted or that they would execute him. As regards the applicant's political activities, it is clear from the facts as found by the Government at the interview with the applicant that such activities commenced some years after he left Iran and that they were peripheral in nature.   It suggests to the Government that his political beliefs are doubtful and are not such as would attract punishment under the Iranian penal system.  He is not a political organiser but merely a supporter of a political party. 12268/87 The Government note that the applicant's credibility has been called into question by various inconsistencies and discrepancies in his version of events.  Thus when interviewed by his solicitor in February 1982 he said that he had been a member of the Mojahedin ""for about a year"" whereas at his interview in August 1981 he claimed that he first began attending demonstrations in 1974.  Similarly in 1982 he told his solicitor he had taken part in two demonstrations in 1981 whereas by 1986 he claims to have been to most major demonstrations. Also in 1982 he claimed that his father had never been involved in politics but later he claimed that his father had been a passive supporter of the Shah and that he had been dispossessed of certain properties.  Finally, the applicant initially claimed to be a member of the Mojahedin although in later interviews it appeared that he was only a supporter. To the above discrepancies must be added the fact of his criminal record which includes offences of dishonesty.  It is submitted that the evidence gives a clear indication of the applicant's propensity to distort and exaggerate the truth for his own ends. It is also submitted that, when considering the applicant's complaint, careful investigation of the character and immigration history of the applicant is called for.  Although Article 3 is absolute and unqualified on its face, the proportionality of Government decisions is a relevant factor in assessing whether they fall into the exceptional category of inhuman treatment.  In the present case, the applicant has committed a number of serious criminal offences while in the United Kingdom which were taken into account by the Secretary of State in refusing him asylum as permitted by Article 33 (2) of the 1951 Convention.  Most seriously he has been concerned in evading the prohibition on the importation of heroin.  The period of imprisonment the applicant ultimately received for this offence, three years, indicates that this was no mere technical infringement.  The applicant is also an overstayer.  It was not until after his first convictions, for overstaying and handling stolen goods, that he applied in June 1982 for asylum.  This was despite his claim to have become a supporter of the Mojahedin in 1979 after the overthrow of the Shah.  Yet he did not feel it necessary to apply for asylum until after his recommendation for deportation which followed his conviction for overstaying. Finally, it is submitted that, bearing in mind the vagueness of the applicant's involvement with political activists hostile to the Government of Iran and the menaces that he, as a convicted criminal and participator in offences connected with the importation of heroin poses to the community, the proposed deportation of the applicant is not in the exceptional category which could be described as inhuman. Further, the decision was taken after full and anxious consideration of all factors and an exhaustive interview with the applicant in the company of his solicitor.  No clear evidence has been provided which points to a serious risk of this applicant's suffering inhuman treament if he were returned to Iran. 12268/87 Article 13 of the Convention It is open to the applicant to apply to the court for leave to move for judicial review on the basis of many of the claims that the applicant seeks to raise before the Commission.  If the court accepts that the applicant has any prospects at all of success, the Court will order that the application for review has suspensive effect upon the deportation procedure until final determination of the application. If an application for judicial review were successful the court would probably quash the refusal of asylum and order that the asylum application be reconsidered in the light of particular factors set out in the judgment.  It is most likely in these circumstances that the application for asylum would be upheld after reconsideration. It is accepted that the principles which an English court will consider upon such an application are not identical to those which will exercise the Commission in its consideration of an Article 3 complaint.  This is because an English court will be guided by the provisions of the 1951 Convention on Refugees and the 1967 Protocol. This is not of course fatal to the Government's case in Article 13. The test is whether the courts are capable of providing an effective remedy. The Government therefore submit that the English courts do provide such a remedy and that this complaint is manifestly ill-founded. The Applicant As to Fact The applicant was interviewed by the Home Office on the 19 August 1986 and gave a very detailed account of his political activities in the United Kingdom prior to his arrest for the drugs offence.  He also gave details of difficulties that he had at that time in connection with the application for the renewal of his Iranian passport due, he claims, to the Iranian authority's knowledge of his political activities at that time.  His drug conviction was known to the Iranian authorities through publicity at the time of his trial and because the fellow Iranian prisoner serving a sentence for terrorist offences was regularly visited by Iranian Consular officials whose discussions with the prisoner made it clear that they were aware of the applicant's conviction as well as his political sympathies. Moreover, he would have come to the notice of the Iranian authorities via persons with whom he associated in Manchester who were known to the Iranian Consulate or via the publicity associated with a hunger strike when he was in prison or consulate ""spies"" who regularly attended dissident meetings.  He also refers to an incident when the Iranaian Consulate wrote to the Home Office (3 March 1983) seeking information concerning the applicant's whereabouts on the pretext that his parents were concerned about him.  He claims that his parents had never approached the Iranian embassy with such a request and that this fact could have been clarified if the Home Office had agreed to interview his parents when they came to the United Kingdom to make representations to the Government. 12268/87 The Government accept that the applicant was knowledgeable about the Mojahedin.  On the evidence available any person who is known by the Iranian authorities to be associated with the Mojahedin would be seriously at risk were they to return to Iran at the present time.  The evidence of such persecution is well-documented and it is not unreasonable to infer that his association would inevitably lead to persecution.  At his interview in August 1986 the applicant explained how the Mojahedin is organised and the fact that supporters are not formal members.  What is significant, however, is the fact that the supporters involve themselves in activities against the present Khomeni Government.  It is those activities which cause them to be identified by the Iranian authorities and render them liable to persecution.  The applicant states that offenders inside Iran have been executed and publicly humiliated and that there is overwhelmning evidence - recently well-documented in a Granada television ""World in Action"" programme - of persons who have been politically active against the Iranian regime in the United Kingdom returning to Iran and being executed.  Since the United Kingdom Government would appear to accept on balance that the Iranian authorities are likely to know about his political activities and the nature of his criminal conviction and in view of the evidence which is available relating to drugs offenders the applicant's fear of persecution is a real one. Article 26  - Domestic Remedies The applicant points out that the Bugdaycay decision (loc. cit.) referred to by the respondent Government was handed down after the date of the application to the Commission by the applicant.  Had there not been an application to the Commission, the Secretary of State would have made no further enquiries.  The applicant complains specifically about the deportation order signed by the Secretary of State in respect of which there is no further appeal. The applicant does not accept that a remedy was available to him in the light of the Bugdaycay decision.  The case of Bugdaycay dealt with applicants who were considered to be ""illegal entrants"" which distinguishes it from the applicant's case.  Secondly, in the Bugdaycay case the Government had accepted that the applicant did qualify as a refugee from Uganda.  Thirdly, it illustrates that judicial review is not a means of reviewing the merits of an application for asylum but simply reviewing the criteria and procedures followed by the Secretary of State in considering an application for asylum.  As Lord Bridge stated : ""I approached the question raised by the challenge to the Secretary of State's decision on the basis of the law stated earlier in this opinion, viz. that the resolution of any issue of fact and the exercise of any discretion in relation to an application for asylum as a refugee lie exclusively within the jurisdiction of the Secretary of State subject only to the Court's power of review"" The applicant maintains in the light of the Bugdaycay case that an application for judicial review made at the time of the original deportation order in 1982 may have had some success given the failure at that time of the United Kingdom Government to interview the applicant.  This should not, however, prejudice the present application because (a) as noted by Lord Bridge the question was 12268/87 raised for the first time in the Bugdaycay case and (b) the only remedy that would have been available in the event of a successful application for judicial review was to direct the Secretary of State to make further enquiries which, of course, is what happened in the interview on 1 August 1986. Finally, it is conceded that the interview on 1 August 1986 covered all relevant points.  It is therefore unlikely that judicial review of the decision taken to maintain the refusal to grant asylum would in this case be open for challenge on the principles developed by the House of Lords Article 3 of the Convention The applicant refers to the documentary evidence submitted with the Government's observations and in particular the letter from the applicant's sister dated 13 June 1985 and the letter dated 7 January 1986 from the President of the Teeside Polytechnic Students Union both of which strongly indicate the risks the applicant would be subject to were he to return to Iran under the present Government. The applicant also contests the Government's claim that he is not concerned about his drug conviction.  As was indicated by his solicitor following the interview in August 1986, he was most concerned about the drug situation in particular because of the fact that the Iranian Government was publicly hanging persons convicted of drugs offences.  In the interview the applicant confirmed that his fellow inmate in Frankland Prison - apparently an Iranian terrorist serving a long sentence- will have passed on information about the applicant to the Iranian authorities who regularly visited him there. It is also clear from the evidence referred to above that he will have come to the notice of the Iranian authorities. Nor can it be a criticism of the applicant that he had not made an earlier application for asylum.  It should be common knowledge that people will be reluctant to make applications for asylum if they can remain in the country on some other basis.  The applicant, like many Iranians, would wish to return to Iran when the situation improves and delayed making an application for asylum until it was absolutely necessary.  Moreover, this view was accepted by Lord Bridge in the Bugdaycay case when dealing with the failure of the Ugandan applicant to claim political asylum on his arrival in the United Kingdom which he entered as a visitor. With respect to the Government's submissions that the applicant's activities are peripheral, it is explained that since he came to the United Kingdom before the revolution it is not surprising that he was not active in Iran and like many Iranians only became actively involved when doubts arose concerning the activites of the revolutionary Government in the years following the revolution.  The applicant's detailed responses to the political ideology and activities of the Peoples' Mojahedin showed a sound knowledge of the organisation and the evidence submitted by the Teesside Polytechnic Students' Union corroborated his accounts of active involvement and the fact that he was known to the Iranian authorities. 12268/87 As regards his criminal convictions the applicant contends that no evidence has been submitted that he represents a danger to the community.  He states, in particular, that it was only in the oral proceedings before the Commission on 7 September 1988 that he learnt that the Secretary of State's refusal of asylum was also based on Article 33 (2) of the 1957 Convention i.e. that he had been convicted of a particularly serious crime.  The letters he had received based the reasons for the decision entirely on a rejection of the applicant's claim that he faced persecution.  He submits, in any event, that Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights is unqualified and that no account should be taken of the applicant's convictions in assessing whether he is likely to be persecuted in Iran.  Finally, he points out that since his release from prison in 1985 he has committed no further offences or come to adverse notice in any way. Article 13 of the Convention It is submitted that the ability to challenge by way of judicial review the decisions of the Secretary of State can in no way be compared to the independent consideration of the merits of a person's application which is afforded by an independent appeals procedure.  This provision requires that the person shall have an effective remedy and the history of the manner in which representations made by the applicant have been dealt with by the Secretary of State indicates that no effective remedy was provided in this case. The attitude of the Government is exemplified in the letter dated 11 March 1986 by the Secretary of State confirming his decision not to defer removal arrangements pending an application to the Commission.  The letters from the applicant's solicitor repeatedly requesting this course of action and interviews with the applicant's parents and himself were dismissed out of hand.  The application for asylum has at no time been independently considered outside the context of his criminal convictions.  Moreover, it is now evident that the application for asylum was prefaced by and considered in the context of his criminal behaviour.  This meant that at no time were the merits of the application given full and independent consideration by the Government.  Failure to provide independent judicial machinery for considering an application for asylum renders the Government in breach of Article 13. THE LAW The applicant complains under Article 3 (Art. 3) of the Convention of the decision of the United Kingdom authorities to deport him to Iran. He claims that if he is sent back to Iran he runs the risk of persecution because of his political activities in the United Kingdom and his conviction for a drug-related  offence.  He further complains under Article 13 (Art. 13) of the Convention that United Kingdom law does not afford him an effective remedy in respect of this complaint under Article 3 (Art. 3). The respondent Government contend with reference to recent United Kingdom court decisions that it would have been open to the applicant to seek judicial review of the Secretary of State's refusal to grant him asylum.  The Government further submit that it would still be open to the applicant to bring such proceedings in respect of the most recent refusal of asylum by the Secretary of State.  It is submitted, therefore, that the complaint should be rejected for failure to exhaust domestic remedies. Article 26 (Art. 26) of the Convention provides as follows: ""The Commission may only deal with the matter after all domestic remedies have been exhausted, according to the generally recognised rules of international law, and within a period of six months from the date on which the final decision was taken."" The Commission recalls that this provision requires exhaustion of remedies which relate to the breach alleged and are at the same time available and sufficient (see Eur.  Court H.R., Van Oosterwijck judgment of 6 November 1986, Series A No. 40, p. 13, para. 27).  In addition the Commission has consistently held that the mere existence of doubts as to the prospects of success does not absolve an applicant from exhausting a given remedy (see Nos. 5577-5583/72, Dec. of 15.12.75, D.R. 4, p. 72 with further references.). In the present case the Commission notes that it is possible under United Kingdom law for the Secretary of State's refusal of asylum to be quashed on the grounds that he had left out of account a factor that should have been taken into account or took into account a factor he should have ignored or that the decision is such that no authority properly directing itself on the relevant law and acting reasonably could have reached it (R. v.  Home Secretary, ex parte Bugdaycay and Others [1987] 2 W.L.R. 606). Moreover the House of Lords has indicated that the courts will apply the above principles extremely strictly against the Home Secretary when a refusal of asylum is under review since the right to life may be at stake (see above ""Domestic law and practice"", dicta of Lord Bridge and Lord Templemore in Bugdaycay, loc. cit.).  It is also clear that, in practice, if the court grants leave to apply for judicial review, the deportation will be stayed until the outcome of the proceedings. The applicant submits that the remedy of judicial review is not effective in his case since the courts will not substitute their view of the merits of the asylum decision for that of the Secretary of State and limit their examination to the decision-making process.  The applicant contends that his complaint is directed to the merits of the Secretary of State's decision to refuse asylum and not to the manner in which he took this decision. The Commission considers that the applicant is required under Article 26 (Art. 26) to have recourse to those remedies which would be adequate and effective to redress his complaints under the Convention. In this respect the Commission notes that the proceedings for judicial review which, according to the submissions of the respondent Government would still be open to him, would enable the applicant to seek to quash the Secretary of State's refusal of asylum with reference to many of the claims that the applicant makes to the Commission in the context of his complaint under Article 3 (Art. 3) of the Convention.  Some of these claims criticise the exercise of discretion by the Secretary of State in reaching his decisions on asylum and thus provide a possible basis on which proceedings for judicial review can be grounded.  In the Commission's opinion such a remedy would have to be tried before the Commission could examine the applicant's complaints, no evidence having been submitted which indicates that in the circumstances of this case the remedy is inadequate or ineffective. The Commission concludes that the applicant has failed to exhaust domestic remedies as required by this provision and that his application must be rejected under Article 27 para. 3 (Art. 27-3) of the Convention.

The second applicant, Mr.  Benjamin Wilson, is a British citizen born in 1916 and currently serving a life sentence in HM Prison Wormwood Scrubs, London. The third applicant, Mr.  Robert Malcolm Weeks, is a citizen of the United Kingdom, born in 1949.  He is, at present, unemployed and living in a mobile home in southern France.  He brought a previous application to the Commission (No. 9787/82) which eventually led to a judgment of the European Court of Human Rights (Eur.  Court H.R., Weeks judgment of 2 March 1987, Series A no. 114). The fourth applicant, Mr.  Edward James Gunnell, is also a citizen of the United Kingdom, born in 1930.  At the time of the introduction of his application he was detained in prison.  He was released on parole on 6 September 1988. The first and third applicants (Thynne and Weeks) are represented before the Commission by Mr.  Peter Ashman, Legal Officer of JUSTICE (British Section of the International Commission of Jurists), London.  The second and fourth applicants (Wilson and Gunnell) are represented before the Commission by Mr.  Paul Hunt, Legal Officer, National Council for Civil Liberties and Mr.  Edward Fitzgerald, of counsel. The facts, which are not disputed by the parties, can be summarised as follows: THYNNE On 27 October 1975 the first applicant, then aged 24, pleaded guilty, at the Central Criminal Court to rape and buggery.  He was sentenced by the Recorder to life imprisonment on each count on 24 November 1975. On 7 August 1975 the applicant, who had just been released from prison, had gained entrance to a flat under the pretence that he was a member of the police force investigating a burglary.  The flat was occupied at the time by a 45 year old married woman.  The applicant told the woman that he had a knife and would kill her if she made a noise.  He then told her to take her clothes off.  He took a pair of scissors which were in the flat and raped and buggered her.  In the course of this assault he inflicted some minor puncture wounds with the scissors.  The applicant had been released from prison the previous day and had been staying with friends in the same block of flats where the offences took place.  It was established in the course of the trial that the offence was committed within 36 hours of the applicant's coming out of prison at a time when he had had little sleep, had consumed a certain amount of alcohol and taken drugs.  He also had a long criminal record, having served various sentences of imprisonment for theft and burglary. Medical evidence which was presented to the Recorder made it clear that a hospital order was not appropriate in the circumstances of his case.  The Recorder considered, however, that an indeterminate life sentence would be the most humane sentence as it would enable the Home Secretary to release him as soon as it was observed that his personality disorder - described by a psychiatrist as a severe psychopathic character disorder - had so improved that it would be reasonably safe to release him.  The Recorder stated as follows: ""But for the psychiatric reports that I have seen I would impose on you a very long prison sentence.  As it is, I am going to sentence you to life on each count in order that those in a position to observe any improvement in your personality disorder, those capable of carrying out any operative treatment which may [be] seen to be necessary, with your consent, on your frontal lobe, may judge the time when it is reasonably safe that you should be free."" The applicant appealed against the life sentences on the ground that they were manifestly excessive and resulted in custody for a longer time than the appropriate determinate sentence.  This appeal was dismissed by the Court of Appeal on 22 March 1976.  The Court pointed out that the attack was serious and violent and subjected the victim to ""indecency"" and ""indignities"".  It did not consider that the life sentence was manifestly excessive and stated as follows: ""We do not see the life sentence in this case as necessarily involving detention in custodial conditions for a very long period of time.  It depends upon the regime to which he is subjected and the treatment he can get.  If a determinate sentence were to be substituted, then the court would have to pass such a sentence as would ensure that he was kept in custody for a longer time than he probably will remain under a life sentence."" The Court considered that the sentence was correct in principle in the circumstances of the case, adding that: ""Life sentences are imposed in circumstances where the offence is so grave that even if there is little risk of repetition it merits such a severe, condign sentence and life sentences are also imposed where the public require protection and must have protection even though the gravity of the offence may not be so serious because there is a very real risk of repetition.  This case falls within neither of these categories which express extreme situations but undoubtedly the offences here were very grave indeed and undoubtedly in the light of the medical reports on this man, the Court cannot be sure by any means that he would, in society, not give way to outbursts of this nature which would very seriously affect other persons."" In May 1977 the applicant was accepted for treatment at Grendon Underwood - a psychiatric prison.  He decided not to accept the place offered on being told that he would not automatically be given early release.  In the opinion of most of the psychiatrists and other doctors dealing with the applicant his personality disorder was not amenable to either surgery or psychiatric treatment.  The Senior Medical Officer at Maidstone Prison diagnosed the applicant as an untreatable aggressive psychopath. The applicant claims that he received only limited therapy between 21 March 1978 and September 1979 which consisted of a short interview by a psychiatrist every two to six weeks. Following representations on the applicant's behalf the Home Secretary decided that the case should be referred to the Joint Parole Board - Home Office Committee the following month.  In August 1980 the Committee recommended that it should be referred to the Local Review Committee in September 1981 when the applicant would have been detained for six years.  The Local Review Committee (which advises the Secretary of State) did not recommend release. After absconding from an open prison on 1 May 1982 the applicant stole a gold bracelet from a jewelery shop and when pursued by the manager of the shop he had brandished, but not used, a knife. He was arrested on 26 July 1982 and found to be in possession of cannabis.  He was placed in a detention room and in an effort to escape he broke a door frame.  He was subsequently sentenced to six months' imprisonment on charges of theft, unlawful possession of drugs and criminal damage.  The sentence was to run concurrently with the existing life sentence. On 22 October 1982 the Parole Board recommended that the applicant's case be referred to the Local Review Committee nine months after his arrival at Maidstone Prison.  However on 16 March 1983, when visiting his mother who was gravely ill, he escaped on an impulse and was recaptured two days later.  The date of the referral of his case to the Local Review Committee was put back to June 1984.  The applicant was transferred to Blundestone Prison in June 1983 where he was examined by the prison department psychiatrist who found no evidence of mental illness and saw no grounds for recommending psychiatric treatment.  The prison's medical officer agreed with these findings.  The Local Review Committee did not recommend release. In July 1985 the applicant's case was referred to the Parole Board which recommended that he remain in a category B Prison with a further review in two years time.  A further review was carried out by the Local Review Committee in July 1987.  It was recommended that he remain in custody.  A further review is scheduled for May 1989. WILSON The second applicant, born in 1916 has a long record of sexual offences beginning in 1935 and has served a number of prison sentences.  On 29 March 1973 he pleaded guilty to charges of buggery and indecent assault on boys under the age of 16 and was sentenced to life imprisonment for buggery and seven years, to be served concurrently, for, inter alia, indecent assault. In passing sentence the Judge said: ""I entirely accept that, to a large extent, you cannot help yourself.  To that extent, your moral guilt is the less, but I have two duties to perform.  One is a duty to find the correct sentence as far as you are concerned, having regard to your make-up; your physical and mental make-up.  The other duty I have, and in the circumstances of this particular case, I think it is the more important: I have a duty to the public, and in particular, to the young public, to protect them from people like you who, for one reason or another, can't control themselves. I hope that, in the course of time a method of treatment for your particular freakish affliction can be found.  I think it will be in the best interest of society generally, and yourself in particular, if some form of treatment for you could be found. What I am going to do in your case may sound harsh from your point of view, but it will be explained to you, no doubt, by <your counsel> hereafter, that it may in fact hold out more hope to you than if I merely went up to perhaps 4, 5 or 6 years, or even 7 years in a particular case. The sentence of the court is that so far as the count of buggery is concerned, that is the eighth count on the indictment, you will go to prison for life.  So far as the counts of attempted buggery and indecent assault are concerned, you will go to prison for a period of 7 years.  All these sentences to be concurrent.  Now I am sure that <your counsel> will have a word with you hereafter and will indicate what the situation is with regard to a life sentence, but as I say, I think my main duty in this particular case is to protect the public and the young public, in the light of what I have heard occurred in your case. I only hope that, in due course, some form of treatment, perhaps that to which the doctor refers in the medical report which I have seen, may help you"". The applicant applied for leave to appeal but abandoned his application.  He later tried to re-open the appeal in November 1976 and, though the Court of Appeal turned down his application, they also expressed the view that the applicant had better prospects of release under a life sentence than a long fixed term sentence if he used the opportunity to improve his character. ""There are circumstances in which the Court is empowered to allow the withdrawal of the notice of abandonment.  The Court has thought it right, as it would have had to say in the end, simply that the applicant has not established a situation in which this Court could properly allow him to withdraw the notice of abandonment.  The Court has thought it right to go to some extent into the history of the matter in order to establish that even if such a withdrawal were permitted, it could not possibly be of advantage to the applicant, if we were to substitute for the life sentence a very long sentence that it really would not be distinguishable from a life sentence.  But if he wishes to take advantage of it, build himself up and strengthen his own character, he has far better prospects under an indeterminate sentence than under a long determinate sentence."" The applicant's case was first referred to the Joint Committee of the Parole Board and the Home Office after three years of his sentence and they recommended that he should be considered for parole after seven years of his sentence.  Thus, on 11 December 1981, the Parole Board recommended, after an interview with the applicant, that he be released into a controlled environment with psychiatric supervision.  The Secretary of State decided to release him on licence on 3 September 1982 on condition that he: i)    live at a probation hostel; ii)    co-operate with his probation officer; iii)    attend on appointed medical practitioner and took any prescribed treatment; and iv)    refrained from any activity involving young boys without the permission of his probation officer. The applicant was released on 14 September 1982 and took up residence at a probation hostel.  He asked for alternative accommodation on the ground that his room was uncomfortable and rain leaked in through the roof.  He also requested permission to join Haringay Athletics Club but this was refused due to possible contact with young boys. On 11 February 1983, the Parole Board recommended his recall and on 14 February 1983 the Secretary of State revoked his licence. The applicant on his return to prison was informed that the reason for his recall was that his conduct gave cause for concern and that he had failed to co-operate with his supervisory officer.  The applicant exercised his right to make written representations against his recall but on 16 September 1983 the Parole Board declined to change the decision. On 6 April 1984, the applicant commenced judicial review proceedings to quash this decision on the ground that he had not been provided with adequate details of the reason for his recall as required by S. 62(3) of the Criminal Justice Act 1967 and that he had accordingly been unable to make effective representations. The Home Office conceded the inadequacy of the reasons given and provided a one page statement of allegations on 5 October 1984, which included the allegations that: i)    the applicant had sought to leave the probation hostel; ii)    a school boys' cap had been found in the living room of the hostel; iii)    the applicant had protested against the probation officer's refusal to allow him to take part in sporting activities; iv)    the applicant had shown an interest in watching boys play football and his psychiatrist suspected that he was exploring ways of contacting boys again. The Home Office then agreed to allow the applicant the opportunity to make further representations to the Parole Board, which he did.  On 7 November 1984, the applicant's solicitors also requested disclosure of a number of reports which were before the Parole Board when it made its decision. On 20 March 1985 the Divisional Court considered the applicant's case.  The court quashed the decision to confirm the applicant's recall made by the Parole Board on 16 September 1983 after referral by the Secretary of State on the ground that it was flawed by a procedural impropriety, in that the applicant had not been given sufficient reasons to enable him to make proper representations.  In the course of these proceedings the applicant's counsel expressly abandoned the argument that the applicant's detention following recall had been unlawful. The applicant's lawyer then requested to see the probation report which alleged non co-operation and that the applicant be given an oral hearing with legal representatives.  However, the Parole Board did not answer this request and after a meeting on 22 March 1985 maintained the decision not to release the applicant. The applicants' case was reconsidered by the Parole Board in November 1986 without a recommendation to release.  He is still in detention. WEEKS The factual background of the application brought by the third applicant has been set out by the European Court of Human Rights in its judgment in the Weeks case (loc. cit., pp. 10-14, paras. 10 - 23). That application arose out of the applicant's sentence to life imprisonment on 6 December 1966 for armed robbery, assaulting a police officer and being in the unlawful possession of a firearm. The present application concerns events which have occurred following the decision of the Commission to declare the former application admissible (No. 9787/82, Dec. 17.1.84, D.R. 35 p. 104). In May 1984 the applicant, who had been released from prison on licence, resigned from his employment as a park keeper following a disageement with another member of staff.  In June 1984 the applicant applied for, and was issued with a passport and left the United Kingdom to seek work in France.  The probation service reported that the applicant was out of touch with his supervising officer, had vacated his flat and was believed to have gone abroad.  The case was referred to the Parole Board which, on 5 October 1984, recommended that the applicant's life licence should be revoked on the grounds that he was in breach of the conditions of his licence.  Condition 6 of his licence required that he seek the prior permission of his probation officer before travelling outside Great Britain. In November 1984 the Home Secretary revoked the applicant's licence on the grounds inter alia that he was in breach of this condition.  When the applicant returned to the United Kingdom in April 1985 he was arrested and returned to prison to resume his life sentence. He was again released on licence on 25 September 1985.  In December 1985, being unable to find work in the United Kingdom, the applicant sought the views of his probation officer about returning to the south of France to resume his work there as a casual labourer. He was informed that he would not be given permission to leave the country so he left without obtaining that permission.  In consequence, the applicant's licence was again revoked and he was liable to re-arrest and re-imprisonment on his return to the United Kingdom. The Parole Board recommended on 7 February 1986 that his licence be revoked on the same ground as in 1984.  The Home Secretary acted on this recommendation on 13 March 1986. Following the judgment of the European Court of Human Rights in his case, the Parole Board, on 3 April 1987, revoked its recommendation that the applicant be recalled.  On 29 April 1987, on the recommendation of the Home Secretary, Her Majesty the Queen remitted the applicant's life sentence by means of the Royal Prerogative.  Accordingly, the applicant is no longer subject to the limitations of a life licence and is no longer liable to be recalled to prison. In the light of the favourable judgment of the Court, the applicant applied for judicial review of the Home Secretary's refusal to pay compensation.  The application was dismissed in February 1988.  The Divisional Court held that the existing ex gratia scheme compensating persons wrongfully imprisoned did not extend to cases such as that of the applicant and that a violation of the Convention was not justiciable in English courts.  The applicant was advised that there was no appeal against this decision. GUNNELL The fourth applicant was found guilty in December 1965 of four offences of rape and two offences of attempted rape, and he was sentenced to life imprisonment.  A pattern was discernible in a number of those offences, in that he approached women at their home and in the gardens of their homes and then committed the offence.  Although there was uncontradicted medical evidence that the applicant was suffering from a ""mental disorder"" within the meaning of that term in the 1959 Mental Health Act (namely psychopathy) and that he needed constant care and treatment in a maximum security medical setting, the sentencing judge nevertheless declined to act on the recommendation of the medical experts and concluded that, because of the gravity of the offences, ""punishment must be an element in this case"" and ""punishment can only be achieved by imprisonment"".  On passing sentence, the trial judge, Mr.  Justice Roskill, stated as follows: ""Edward James Gunnell, you stand convicted of no less than four charges of rape and two of attempted rape, as well as three charges of stealing, two of which were connected with two of the rapes, and all those offences were committed within the period of a month.  It is only thanks to the courage of the two women involved, those concerned in counts 1 and 2, that you are not standing convicted on no less than six charges of rape.  These must be amongst the worst cases of rape or attempted rape ever to come before a court in this country.  But though I accept you have spent much of your early life in mental institutions, and I accept certain evidence I have heard this morning that you are suffering from psychopathic disorder, the evidence leaves no doubt and can leave no doubt in anybody's mind, that you did know what you were doing and you were well aware of the wickedness of what you had done.  I have listened with great attention to the medical evidence which I have had the opportunity of hearing this morning, and I have endeavoured to give all the weight to it that I properly can. It has been urged upon me that I should deal with you by making a hospital order and sending you to Rampton, where you will be kept in secure conditions and receive any treatment which you may require.  In many cases it is clearly right for a court in discharging its responsibilities to have regard solely or mainly to the needs of the offender, but the present case in my view is one of such magnitude that I cannot only have regard to such needs.  It is true, to send you to Rampton would involve you being kept under secure conditions and to that extent would keep the public from you.  But there are other matters which I must take into account in the public interest, not the least of which is to make it clear that crimes of this kind committed against ordinary housewives in their ordinary homes doing their every day business while their men-folk are away at work are such as must, when brought home to a particular offender, be dealt with in such a way as to make plain that the law is concerned and ever will be concerned to protect people who suffer as you caused these women to suffer by these quite appalling sexual attacks that you made upon them.  Punishment must be an element in this case, and that punishment can only be achieved by imprisonment. Imprisonment will afford security to the public from you, and the Home Secretary has ample power if and when the need for treatment arises, to transfer you to any institution where such treatment can be received. In my judgment there is only one sentence which is appropriate in this case, and I will deal with count 3 first.  Upon count 3 the sentence of the court is that you be imprisoned for the term of your natural life.  There will be corresponding life sentences on counts 4, 5 and 7, upon which you stand convicted of rape.  On the first two counts in the indictment, those of attempted rape the sentence will be one of 7 years imprisonment, such sentences to run concurently with one another and with the life sentence.  On count 6 and count 8 there will be sentences concurrent with each other of 3 years' imprisonment and concurrent with the life sentences.  On count 9 there will be a concurrent sentence of two years' imprisonment.  Those are the sentences of the court on every count."" The applicant was refused leave to appeal to the Court of Appeal on 22 June 1966.  In the course of his judgment the Lord Chief Justice stated: ""It is a shocking case and there is no conceiviable ground upon which he could succeed in his application for leave to appeal against conviction.  Indeed, all he says is that he would like to call three of the women complainants to challenge their evidence all over again.  This court refuses the extension of time in which to apply for leave to appeal against conviction. In regard to the application for leave to appeal against sentence in regard to the rapes and attempted rapes, the applicant is 35 and, though he has committed offences before, none of them have been offences of violence or of a sexual nature, but he has a long mental history.  As long ago as 1946 he was committed to Manor Hospital, Epsom, from which he escaped 18 times.  In 1950 he was admitted to Farmfield Hospital, Horley.  He absconded three times.  In 1951 he was transferred to Rampton hospital where he made no attempts to escape, possibly knowing that it is difficult to do so.  In 1959, however, he was released on licence from Rampton and in 1960 he was discharged from the operation of the Mental Deficiency Act 1959. There was evidence, indeed it was uncontradicted, from the doctors that the applicant could be made the subject of a hospital order under the Mental Health Act 1959, in that he was a psychopath who needed constant care and treatment in a medical setting of maximum security such as Rampton and such a vacancy was then available.  The learned judge refused to take that course and the ground of appeal here is that he was wrong in principle, when two doctors certified that the applicant was a fit subject for a hospital order and that treatment was warranted, not sending him to hospital but sending him to prison ... This court would like it to be known that they agree with every word that the learned judge there said, indeed in an earlier case of Morris [1961] 2 QB 237, it was pointed out that there may be cases where although a court has powers to make a hospital order, yet where a punishment is required it would be right to send the offender to prison, it being recognised that the Home Secretary has ample powers under section 72 of the Mental Health Act 1959 to cause him to be treated in hospital when the need arises. This court would like to add one further reason justifying the judge's order in the present case.  The applicant is obviously a dangerous psychopath.  It is clear unless he is kept in circumstances of strict security he is liable to be a menace to the public.  True, Rampton is said to be a secure hospital, but it does not mean that he would not get away from there.  More important, it has to be observed that this dangerous psychopath has already been released on licence from Rampton.  Bearing the interests of the public in mind, this court thinks it far safer that he should be kept in prison for as long as is necessary rather than he should be left to be dealt with as a hospital might deal with him, on a doctor and patient relationship under which it might be considered safe for him to be free, whereas from the public angle he remains a menace. This court is quite satisfied that the sentence was right and the application is refused."" In December 1980 the Parole Board recommended that, subject to continued good conduct, to the satisfactory completion of periods both in open conditions and the pre-release employment scheme, the applicant should be released on licence under the provisions of the Criminal Justice Act 1967.  On 7 September 1981 he joined the pre-release employment scheme at Wormwood Scrubs prison.  Arrangements were made for him to take anti-libidinal drugs and he was released on licence on 4 March 1982. On 19 February 1983 information was received from Finchley Police that the applicant had been seen watching a woman cleaning her car and had then been found in her back garden.  The police said that there had been a similar incident in January 1983, when a woman complained to the police that the applicant was in her back garden looking through her rear window.  The police had arrested the applicant on that occasion but did not hold him.  Following the second incident, the Minister of State authorised the immediate revocation of the applicant's life licence under Section 62 (2) of the 1967 Act on 19 February 1983 because of the similarities between the applicant's current behaviour and the circumstances in which the original offences were committed.  The applicant was taken to Pentonville Prison the same day and was subsequently transferred to Wormwood Scrubs.  At no stage of the proceedings was he charged with any criminal offence in relation to the incidents in January and February 1983. The applicant was interviewed by the Assistant Governor on 25 February 1983 and states that he was told that his licence had been revoked ""because his  behaviour was giving cause for concern"".  He was also informed of his right under Section 62 (3) of the 1967 Act to make written representations to the Parole Board. The applicant was subsequently seen by a member of the Local Review Committee on 1 March 1983.  On 4 March 1983 the Parole Board confirmed the revocation of the applicant's licence when the case was referred to them under Section 62 (4) of the 1967 Act.  On 25 March the Parole Board rejected the applicant's representations but recommended that, subject to satisfactory re-settlement arrangements being made and to continuing psychiatric supervision he should be released in a month's time.  The Secretary of State decided not to accept the Board's recommendation after consultations with the Lord Chief Justice and the trial judge in accordance with Section 67 (1) of the 1967 Act.  The applicant subsequently petitioned the Secretary of State, complaining that he had not been allowed to defend himself. The petition was rejected in a reply dated 3 August 1983.  The applicant states that the reply contained the first written explanations of the reasons for his recall and the first official account in any detail of the allegations made against him. On 9 August 1983 the applicant applied for leave to move for judicial review of the decisions of the Parole Board and the Home Secretary, confirming the initial revocation of the licence.  The applicant was granted leave to move for judicial review on 18 August 1983.  His application was eventually dismissed on 2 November 1983. An appeal against this decision to the Court of Appeal was also dismissed on 30 October 1984.  The applicant's case was reviewed again by the Parole Board and the Home Secretary in 1984 but he was not released.  He was released on licence once more in September 1988. Relevant domestic law and practice By virtue of section 37 of, and Schedule 2 to, the Sexual Offences Act 1956 the maximum punishment for rape is life imprisonment.  The maximum penalty for buggery with a boy under the age of 18 is life imprisonment by virtue of Section 37 of, and Schedule 2 to, the 1956 Act. Under the Criminal Justice Act 1967 the Secretary of State may only release on licence a person sentenced to life imprisonment if recommended to do so by the Parole Board, and after consultation with the Lord Chief Justice of England and the trial judge if available. In practice the Home Secretary consults the Lord Chief Justice and the trial judge as to the period on detention necessary to satisfy the needs for retribution and deteterrence, i.e. the tariff period. By virtue of section 62 (1) the Secretary of State may revoke the licence of a person, whose recall to prison is recommended by the Parole Board.  A prisoner recalled in such circumstances is entitled to be informed of the reasons for his recall and of his right to make representations.  If he makes representations the Secretary of State must refer his case to the Board.  If the Board recommends the immediate release of a re-called prisoner, the Secretary of State is bound to give effect to the recommendation. Under section 62 (2) the Secretary of State may himself revoke the licence of a life licensee without consulting the Parole Board if it appears expedient in the public interest to do so before such consultation is practicable;  but the case of a prisoner so recalled must be referred to the Board.  If the Board recommends the immediate release of a re-called prisoner, the Secretary of State is bound to give effect to the recommendation. Under Section 59 of the 1967 Act the Secretary of State has established for every prison a Local Review Committee with the function of advising him on the suitability for release on licence of prisoners.  It is the practice to obtain a Local Review Committee's assessment before referring the case to the Parole Board.  The date when a life sentence prisoner's case was to be referred to the Parole Board was normally determined by a joint Parole Board-Home Office Committee. Section 60 (4) of the 1967 Act provides that a person subject to a licence shall comply with such conditions, if any, as may for the time being be specified in the licence.  Section 60 (5) provides: ""The Secretary of State shall consult the Board before including on release, or subsequently inserting, a condition in a licence under this section or varying or cancelling any such condition;  and for the purposes of this subsection the Secretary of State shall be treated as having consulted the Board about a proposal to include, insert, vary or cancel a condition in any case if he has consulted the Board about the implementation of proposals of that description generally or in that class of case."" It is the practice that all prisoners released on life licence are required to remain under the supervision of a probation officer. The licensee maintains regular contact with his probation officer and obtains his probation officer's approval for the place where he lives and works. COMPLAINTS The  first applicant (Thynne) complains under Article 5 para. 4 of the Convention of the absence of any procedure under the law of the United Kingdom by which he can have reviewed the continuing lawfulness of his detention by a court. The second applicant (Wilson) makes the following complaints, also under Article 5 para. 4 of the Convention: i)      between March 1973 and September 1982, i.e. the date of his release on licence, he was deprived of the right to have the lawfulness of his continued detention determined at reasonable intervals by a ""court"" which could determine the substantive merits of the justification advanced by the authorities for his continued detention; ii)     between 14 February 1983 and 22 March 1985 he was deprived of his right to have the lawfulness of his recall and renewed detention determined by a ""court"" competent to decide whether the recall and detention were justified; and iii)    since March 1985, he has been deprived of his right to a periodic review of the lawfulness of his detention at reasonable intervals by a ""court"". He further complains under Article 5 para. 5 of the Convention that there is no enforceable right to compensation in respect of the above breaches of Article 5 para. 4 under the law of the United Kingdom. The third applicant (Weeks) complains that his re-detention was in breach of Article 5 para. 1 of the Convention in that there exists no sufficient connection between his original conviction in 1966 and the decision to re-detain him because of a breach of an administrative requirement, i.e. one of the conditions of his licence. He further alleges a breach of Article 5 para. 4 of the Convention in that he was unable to take proceedings to challenge the lawfulness of the decision to re-detain him. Finally, he alleges a breach of Article 5 para. 5 of the Convention in that there is no enforceable right  to compensation under the law of the United Kingdom. The fourth applicant (Gunnell) complains under Article 5 para. 4 of the Convention that he was unable to challenge before a court the lawfulness of the decision to re-detain him. Complaints originally made by the second applicant (Wilson) under Articles 5 para. 1 (e) and 5 para. 2 and by the fourth applicant (Gunnell) under Article 5 para. 2 of the Convention were expressly withdrawn in the course of the hearing before the Commission. PROCEEDINGS BEFORE THE COMMISSION The first application (Thynne) was introduced on 3 June 1985 and registered on 10 September 1985. The second application (Wilson) was introduced on 1 September 1985 and registered on 1 February 1986. The third application (Weeks) was introduced on 3 October 1985 and registered on 14 February 1986. The fourth application (Gunnell) was introduced on 24 April 1985 and registered on 12 February 1986. The applications were first examined by the Commission on 1 December 1986 (Thynne), 1 February 1986 (Wilson), 1 December 1986 (Weeks) and 18 July 1986 (Gunnell). The Commission decided to give notice of the applications to the respondent Government but not to ask for their observations on the admissibility and merits of the cases until judgment had been handed down by the European Court of Human Rights in the Weeks case (Eur. Court H.R., judgment of 2 March 1987, Series A no. 114). On 1 April 1987, following the judgment of the Court in the Weeks case, the President of the Commission requested submissions on the admissiblity and merits of the applications insofar as they raised issues under Article 5 of the Convention.  The Government's observations were submitted on 12 June 1987 (Thynne, Wilson and Gunnell) and 20 July 1987 (Weeks).  The applicants' observations in reply were subitted on 21 July 1987 (Thynne), 23 September 1987 (Wilson), 25 September 1987 (Weeks) and 29 October 1987 (Gunnell). The Commission next considered the applications on 9 March 1988 when it was decided to hold a joint oral hearing to take place in Strasbourg on 6 September 1988. The applicant Wilson was granted legal aid by decision of the Commission on 13 May 1988. The applicants Thynne and Wilson were granted legal aid by decision of the President on 19 August 1988. At the hearing, at which the applications were joined pursuant to Rule 29 of the Commission's Rules of Procedure, the parties were represented as follows: Respondent Government Mr.  M. C. Wood, Foreign and Commonwealth Office, Agent Mr.  A. Moses,   Counsel Mr.  C. Osborne, Home Office, Adviser Mrs.  V. Harris, Home Office, Adviser The applicants (for MM. Wilson and Gunnell): Mr.  E. Fitzgerald, counsel Mr.  P. Hunt, Legal Officer, National Council for Civil Liberties (for MM. Thynne and Weeks): Mr.  P. Ashman, Legal Officer, JUSTICE SUBMISSIONS OF THE PARTIES Respondent Government Article 5 para. 1 (a) of the Convention WEEKS The Government refer to the decision of the Court in the Weeks case (loc. cit.) concerning the interpretation of Article 5 para. 1 (a) of the Convention.  In particular the Court has held that there was a sufficient causal connection between the applicant's conviction in 1966 and his re-detention in 1977, after having examined the sufficiency of the grounds on which the re-detention in 1977 was based, bearing in mind the discretion conferred by the Convention on the national authorities in this area. The Government submit that the release which the life sentence system provides for is release on licence and that licensees have to subject themselves to supervision by a probation officer.  It follows that the monitoring of a life sentence prisoner's progress continues after he has been released through contact with the probation officer.  Such monitoring is only possible if the licensee maintains regular contact with the probation officer.  It breaks down if the licensee goes abroad without permission. Once a prisoner has been released, the authorities lose direct control over him and the necessary continuing contact with the probation officer can only be maintained with his co-operation.  The authorities cannot compel him to maintain that contact.  The only effective sanction which they have is recall to prison.  Thus the revocation of a life licence may be the only effective way of reminding a licensee, as well as other life sentence prisoners and licensees, of the licence obligations. In the present case the applicant had from June 1984 to the time of his re-arrest, been out of touch with his probation officer as a result of having moved his residence to France.  This constitutes a breach of the conditions attached to the applicant's licence.  In these circumstances the continued supervision required by his licence could no longer take place. Accordingly the applicant's re-arrest in May 1985 was in no way arbitrary or unreasonable in terms of the sentence imposed on him.  His failure to maintain contact with the probation officer and his subsequent re-arrest were consistent with the objectives of the sentencing court which were that the applicant should be subject to continuing supervision even after release from prison.  If the applicant's argument was correct it would mean that the Home Secretary could never recall a person on licence for breach of licence conditions but could only recall him if he considered that person to be a danger to himself or to the public.  It is therefore submitted that there has been no breach of Article 5 para. 1 of the Convention. General ------- The Government refer to the decision of the European Court of Human Rights in the Weeks case (Eur.  Court H.R., judgment of 2 March 1987, Series A no. 114) where the Court held that, in the case of life sentences falling into a special category, the prisoner was entitled to apply to a court-like body to have the lawfulness of his detention following recall and continuing detention reviewed.  In such a case, the supervision required by Article 5 para. 4 was not incorporated in the decision of the sentencing court.  However, in the Weeks case, the Court stressed that the purpose for which the defendant's sentence had been imposed, taken together with the particular facts relevant to the offence placed the sentence in a special category.  Neither the trial judge nor the Court of Appeal in the Weeks case had suggested that the offence in itself was so serious as to merit a life sentence.  Moreover, the Court was careful to distinguish Mr.  Weeks's exceptional sentence, which was imposed solely for the purpose stated by the trial court and the Court of Appeal, from the unexceptional life sentence imposed where the gravity of the offence is one of the reasons for the imposition of the sentence. It follows from the Court's judgment that, for the purposes of Article 5 of the Convention, life sentences in the United Kingdom fall into two categories.  The first category consists of two types of life sentence which are distinct in English law, namely mandatory life sentences and discretionary life sentences.  In the case of mandatory life sentences, the offences are so grave that Parliament has legislated that no discretion should be given to the court as to the appropriate sentence.  In the case of discretionary life sentences, the combination of the gravity of the offence and the danger presented to the public by the offender is such as to merit an indeterminate sentence.  The combination of gravity and dangerousness gives rise to a special need for the Home Secretary to maintain public confidence in the system of life sentences. The second category is the special category that the Weeks case belongs where the life sentence is imposed solely to meet the need for continued supervision and custody.  It is submitted that this category is very small and that the Weeks case is unique. The Government submit that the applicants' submissions based on the Handscombe decision (R v.  Secretary of State for the Home Department, ex parte Handscombe and Others (1988) 86 Cr.  App.  R.59) are misconceived since the gravity of the offence is also part of the justification for re-detention.  The gravity of the offence gives rise to a special consideration of maintaining public confidence in the life sentence system.  The Home Secretary's duty in this respect means that he must have regard to the risk to the public involved in the release of a particular prisoner in the light of the gravity of the offence.  Such judgment may depend on issues of fact which are not susceptible to judicial analysis.  Courts, unlike the Home Secretary, are not answerable to the public. THYNNE The Government submit that the facts of this application place it in a wholly different category from that of Mr.  Weeks.  In contrast with the Weeks case, the facts of the applicant's offence were of the utmost seriousness, as reflected in the remarks of the trial judge and the Court of Appeal.  The applicant had raped and buggered a 45 year-old married woman after gaining entrance to her flat by claiming to be a policeman.  He threatened her, saying he had a knife, struck her and attempted to strangle her.  It is clear that the incident was very grave and that retribution and deterrence were important elements in the imposition of the two life sentences. The Government accept that an element in the choice of a life sentence was the possibility of monitoring the applicant's progress in prison so that he could receive the necessary treatment.  However, this did not place the applicant's case into the special category identified by the Court in the Weeks case.  It is clear that the life sentence imposed involved a substantial element of punishment for the gravity of the offence committed. The applicant has not been released because the Home Secretary, in the light of his responsibility for public safety, and in the light of his responsiblity to maintain public confidence, does not consider it safe to do so.  It is submitted that such a consideration is not a suitable matter for a ""court"" to determine.  It is difficult to see how the issue as to whether he should be released or not is susceptible to a hearing at which Mr.  Thynne can make representations. Accordingly, the requirements of Article 5 para. 4 are met by the proceedings before the sentencing court and the subsequent appeal. Finally, the Government note that medical opinion is unanimous in the view that the applicant's personality disorder is not susceptible to treatment.  His case is, nevertheless, kept under regular review. WILSON The Government submit that it is beyond dispute that offences which involve sexual interference with children are very grave.  The applicant has a long history of convictions for buggery and indecent assault on young boys going back to 1935.  Such offences may have a lasting detrimental effect on the psychological and emotional development of the young.  It is for this reason that English law distinguishes buggery with children under the age of 16 from offences with men over that age as an offence for which it is necessary to retain a maximum sentence of life imprisonment.  The applicant's criminal history, taken together with the facts of his offences in 1973 show a high degree of damaging physical interference with the young. Both the trial judge and the Court of Appeal recognised that punishment was an important element in the sentence.  In such circumstances the Government submit that, even though there was an intention that the applicant should be subject to supervision for the protection of the public, the life sentence was justified having regard to the seriousness of the applicant's behaviour.  The requirements of Article 5 para. 4 are thus incorporated in the decision of the sentencing court. WEEKS The Government point out that he was recalled in 1984 because of breaches of the conditions of his licence and not because he was considered to be a danger to the public which was the reason for his recall in 1977.  However, the applicant's special category position relates only to decisions to recall him because he was a danger to the public.  It is this feature which was susceptible to change over time which has therefore made his case analogous to the Van Droogenbroeck case (Eur.  Court H.R. judgment of 24 June 1982, Series A no. 50). However, the grounds for recall in 1984 to 1985 were the breaches of the licence conditions which rendered it impossible for the Home Secretary to determine whether the applicant was dangerous or not. Such grounds do not change over the passage of time. The Government also point out that as a result of the exercise of the Royal Prerogative the applicant is no longer subject to his life licence.  He is thus no longer liable to be recalled to prison and there can, accordingly, be no continuing breach of Article 5 para. 4 of the Convention. GUNNELL The Government contend that the facts of this application place it in a wholly different category from that of Mr.  Weeks, since his offences were of the utmost seriousness as reflected in the remarks of both Mr.  Justice Roskill and the Court of Appeal.  The applicant was convicted on four separate charges of rape of four married women and received a sentence of life imprisonment in respect of each count.  The offences were described by the trial judge as amongst the worst cases of rape to come before an English court.  It is clear that the life sentence imposed involved a substantial element of punishment.  It is submitted that the undisputed existence of an element of retribution and deterrence means that the applicant's case cannot fall into the Weeks special category.  The trial judge could have imposed a hospital order which would have involved the applicant's detention in Rampton, which is a secure special hospital. As the judge acknowledged, detention in Rampton would have provided the necessary public protection.  However, he rejected the course of a hospital order and imposed a life sentence expressly in order to punish the applicant and to deter others from emulating his offences. It is therefore submitted that the requirements of Article 5 para. 4 were satisfied by the applicant's trial and subsequent appeal. Article 5 para. 5 of the Convention WILSON and WEEKS The Government submit that Article 5 para. 5 is intended to confer an enforceable right to compensation only in cases where there has been a contravention of the provisions of paras. 1 - 4 by reason of the fact that the arrest or detention is not lawful within the meaning of those paragraphs.  Such an interpretation not only accords more closely with the intention of the drafters of the Convention but reconciles the provisions of paras. 4 and 5 of Article 5.  It follows that in the Wilson case Article 5 para. 5 does not come into play since the arrest and detention was lawful. In the case of Weeks, the Government note that the complaint appears to relate to the application of Article 5 para. 5 in relation to the breach of Article 5 para. 4 which was found by the Court to have taken place in respect of his earlier application.  The applicant did not make any complaint under Article 5 para. 5 in this earlier application.  Moreover, the question of damages for breach of Article 5 para. 4 under Article 50 of the Convention is pending before the Court.  It is clear from the case-law that the Court will take into consideration under Article 50 the rule of substance contained in Article 5 para. 5.  In these circumstances, the Government submit that it is neither necessary nor appropriate for the Commission to consider the application of Article 5 para. 5 in relation to the breach of Article 5 para. 4 found by the Court. The applicants Article 5 para. 1 (a) of the Convention WEEKS The applicant submits that the only proper interpretation of the judgment of the Court in respect of this provision is that no violation was established because the Court had found that there was evidence upon which the Home Secretary could conclude that the applicant was a danger to the public and himself.  The causal link between the original conviction and re-detention was created by the test of dangerousness. The applicant points out that after his release on licence in 1982 there was a period of unstable behaviour which resulted in a number of minor criminal convictions for which he received modest penalties.  However, neither the Parole Board nor the courts nor the Home Secretary considered these matters to be sufficiently grave to re-detain the applicant in 1983.  They cannot be relied upon by the Government now as a justification for his deprivation of liberty in April 1985. The applicant was re-detained in April 1985 by way of a punishment for failing to comply with the conditions of his licence. It is significant that the Government made no attempt to seek the extradition of the applicant from France on the grounds that he was a dangerous offender who was unlawfully at large. With respect to the Government's argument that the power to re-detain is essential to ensure compliance with licence obligations the applicant states that this is tantamount to an argument based on Article 5 para. 1 (b) of the Convention.  However, the Commission has specifically held in the case of Eggs v.  Switzerland (No. 7341/78, Comm.  Report 4.3.78, D.R. 15 p. 35) that deprivation of liberty to compel fulfilment of an obligation is only permissible where that obligation is specific and concrete.  In the present case the penal sanction was applied as punishment for past behaviour and was not intended to secure the fulfilment of a legal obligation.  The Home Secretary was not simply executing the judgment of the original sentencing court but was imposing his own disciplinary sanction for failing to obey the conditions he had imposed.  The true reason underlying his recall was not because of perceived dangerousness but to punish the applicant and in so doing discourage other licencees from breaching the conditions of their licence.  The amount of time actually served by the applicant after recall (five months and seventeen days) was the equivalent, with remission, of a sentence of over eight months' imprisonment.  This is a penalty which can only be imposed in England by the Circuit judges in the Crown Court for serious offences. It is accordingly submitted that the applicant's detention was not lawful within the meaning of this provision. Article 5 para. 4 of the Convention General ------- The applicants submit that the basic flaw in the Government's argument is to treat discretionary life sentences as belonging to the same category as mandatory life sentences.  Following this approach, the Government submit that the applicants Thynne, Wilson and Gunnell have been punished because of the gravity of the offence.  However, it is clear that the discretionary life sentence falls to be distinguished from a mandatory life sentence. Firstly it is clearly established in United Kingdom law that a disretionary life sentence is imposed not only because the offence is a grave one, but because the accused is regarded as mentally unstable and dangerous (e.g.  Picker (1970) 54 Cr.  App.  R 330;  Wilkinson (1983) 5 Cr.  App.  R (S) 105; Headly (1979), 1 Cr.  App.  R (S) 159).  For example, the Court of Appeal in the case of Picker stated as follows in relation to the discretionary life sentence in general: ""Where the nature of the offence and the make-up of the offender are of such a nature that the public requires protection for a considerable period of time ... it is right for the judge to impose a life sentence ... but where no such conditions exist it is quite clear that a judge should not pass the difficult matter of sentencing and the length of detention to others"" (p. 332). Second, the discretionary life sentence is preferred to a fixed-term sentence only when punishment is not the sole objective and it is necessary to authorise detention by the executive beyond the period that would have been merited as punishment in order to protect the public. Third, in the recent decision of the Divisional Court (R v.  Secretary of State for the Home Department, ex parte Handscombe & Others (1988) 86 Cr.  App.  R. 59) the Court recognised that every discretionary life sentence contains within it an authority to detain a prisoner for the purposes of punishment for no longer than he would have served if he had been sentenced to a fixed-term sentence as punishment for his offence rather than an indeterminate sentence because of his dangerousness.  It further contains an additional authority to detain the prisoner beyond this tariff or punitive period if he continues to remain a danger to the public.  In his judgment, Lord Justice Watkins indicated that the rationale of the discretionary life sentence leads to the conclusion that the punitive part of the sentence is completed at a particular point in time.  He stated: ""On the other hand, the tariff in the discretionary life sentence is the appropriate fixed-term sentence in the absence of a mental element, the existence of which led to the life sentence."" The Handscombe judgment recognises that after the completion of the punitive period, dangerousness becomes the sole justification for further detention. It follows from the above analysis that prisoners like Thynne, Wilson and Gunnell reached a point where they had completed the tariff period of their sentences.  At that point they could only be detained further if they were still considered to be dangerous.  From that point on they were in precisely the same position as the applicants in the Van Droogenbroeck and Weeks cases (loc. cit.).  Justification for any recall and continued detention depends entirely on the continued presence of a propensity to dangerous behaviour which is susceptible to change with time. The applicants point out that an offender sentenced to a fixed-term sentence has the benefit of one-third remission of sentence for good behaviour.  They also submit an affidavit (29 July 1988) from a recognised expert in sentencing (Dr.  D. A. Thomas, author of Principles of Sentencing, 1979, Heinemann) who has studied extensively the practice of the Court of Appeal in this area.  He states with reference to the practice of the Court of Appeal in sentencing matters that there is an upper limit of 10 years for offences of buggery against minors, in the absence of mental instability.  He further states that the upper limit for the worst type of rape, where punishment is the sole object, is 18 years. THYNNE The applicant points out that the sentence of life imprisonment for rape is not a common one.  Between 1977 and 1986 criminal statistics for England and Wales show that 3,765 men were convicted of rape, of whom only 85 were sentenced to life imprisonment.  As was indicated by Dr.  Thomas, it is almost always for reasons of personality disorder that a life sentence is imposed and rarely, if ever, as pure punishment.  Under current practice in England, the period of detention which has to be served for the purposes of retribution and deterrence in an indeterminate sentence can be estimated from the date of the first parole review plus three years.  In the applicant's case this would mean that a period of punishment would have been recommended by the trial judge and the Lord Chief Justice of 9 years' imprisonment to represent retribution. In 1980 all the medical experts had agreed that the applicant was not suffering from any mental illness and that no medical or psychiatric treatment was available to him.  The applicant had various reviews by the Local Review Committee and the Parole Board between September 1981 and July 1987.  No reasons were given to him for the recommendations which were that he remain in custody and he was not allowed to see the reports on which these recommendations were based. A further review is scheduled for May 1989 which means that, effectively, the earliest hope of a date of release is 1992, by which time he will have served 17 years' imprisonment for these offences:  9 years for punishment and 8 years for potential risk. Against this background, it is submitted that there has been a breach of Article 5 para. 4 of the Convention in the applicant's case, because of the lack of periodic review of lawfulness, for the same reasons as in the Weeks case.  Although the facts of the applicant's case differ from the Weeks case the reasons on which their sentences were based are, in principle, the same.  Each was given a life sentence not necessarily because of the gravity of the crime but because their psychological condition warranted supervision.  Hospitals were not available at the time and therefore life sentences were imposed so that they could be detained for the purposes of social protection and monitored for the rest of their lives either in detention or on a life licence.  These considerations are reflected in the reasons given for the sentence by the Recorder and in the Court of Appeal. Although there was undoubtedly an element of punishment in the applicant's sentence it was not the overriding factor in the imposition of the sentence.  The difference between Weeks and the present case is one of degree with the applicant's sentence containing a greater element of punishment.  However, once the retributive period had ended the sole basis for continuing detention is as a security measure in the interests of public safety. WILSON The applicant submits that his own life sentence was not imposed because of the gravity of the offence he had committed.  His offence would only have justified a long fixed term sentence which would undoubtedly have allowed for his release within ten years as noted by Dr.  Thomas.  He is still detained after 15 years.  The additional factors justifying the imposition of the life sentence were his mental affliction and the need to protect the public.  Thus the trial judge made specific reference to the fact that the punishment of moral guilt was not his purpose so much as the protection of the public.  He also indicated that an indeterminate sentence allowed for the applicant's release by the executive at an earlier stage than if a fixed term sentence had been imposed. The applicant states that the Government's submission that his sentence was imposed because of the seriousness of the offence is wholly inconsisent with the principles governing the imposition of discretionary life sentences in sexual cases in general and buggery in particular.  The Court of Appeal has consistently held that a life sentence can only be imposed in cases of buggery if the person is mentally unstable.  He refers to the cases of Simpson (1981) 3 Cr. App.  R(S) 345 and Johanssen (1977) 65 Cr.  App.  R 101 and the affidavit submitted by Dr.  Thomas.  The applicant concludes that his case also falls into a special category which attracts the safeguards of Article 5 para. 4 of the Convention. WEEKS The applicant submits that his inability to challenge the circumstances of the revocation of his licence did not materially differ from the situation in 1977 which the Court found to violate Article 5 para. 4.  The applicant spent 170 days in Winchester prison which is the equivalent, with remission, of a sentence of 8 months' imprisonment.  This is a sentence which the courts can only impose for more serious offences. He contends that the Government have conceded that there was a violation of Article 5 para. 4 in respect of the applicant's re-detention in April 1985.  He maintains, however, that he has served longer in prison than he would have done if the Article 5 para. 4 guarantees had been in force.  If a domestic court with competent jurisdiction had considered the justification for his re-detention in the light of the criteria laid down by the original sentencing court, it would have found it inadequate. While it is true that the applicant can no longer be recalled to prison, the Commission must have regard to the situation prevailing in April 1985.  If the applicant was detained in breach of the provisions of Article 5 para. 4 he was wrongly detained and he should be compensated. GUNNELL The applicant accepts that his offences were of a serious nature which might have attracted a fixed-term punishment of up to 18 years (cf. affidavit of Dr.  Thomas).  However, he had a long history of detention in mental hospitals as a mental defective and as someone diagnosed by at least two doctors as suffering from psychopathy.  As such he satisfied the extra condition of mental instability which justified the imposition of a life sentence rather than a long fixed-term sentence.  He submits that the judge could not lawfully have imposed, nor could the Court of Appeal have upheld, a life sentence if this additional feature had not been present.  He refers to the following statement of the Court of Appeal in the case of Headley (1979) 1 Cr.  App.  R (S) 158: ""The sentence of life imprisonment is inappropriate, even for grave sexual ofences, where there is no evidence that the offender is in need of treatment or is likely to be a danger to society in the future."" The applicant states that the Court of Appeal made it clear when it described him as a dangerous psychopath that protection of the public was the real determinant of the choice of the life sentence. Moreover, the Court justified the choice of a life sentence because it was not satisfied that an indefinite hospital order would provide for the protection of the public as well as a life sentence. When the applicant was released on licence in March 1982 he had served 17 years in custody - the equivalent of a fixed term of 25 years.  At that stage his release must have been approved by the Lord Chief Justice and the trial judge after the process of statutory consultation required by Section 61 (2).  They must have approved it on the basis that the applicant had served the tariff period necessary for punishment.  Thereafter it cannot be said, as the Government maintain, that the applicant's recall can be justified on the grounds of retribution.  In this post-tariff stage, the sole question, as the Divisional Court in Handscombe establishes, is the applicant's continuing dangerousness to the public. The applicant notes that he was recalled on the basis of police allegations but was never given an opportunity to test those allegations by cross-examination or by giving evidence himself. Article 5 para. 5 WILSON and WEEKS The applicant Wilson submits that since there is no right to enforceable compensation under United Kingdom law in respect of his complaints there is also a breach of Article 5 para. 5 of the Convention. The applicant Weeks complains that he has been denied an enforceable right to compensation in respect of the foregoing breaches of Article 5.  He points out that there is no statutory scheme in the United Kingdom for compensating persons wrongfully detained and that the Divisional Court has refused to give any effect to the judgment of the European Court of Human Rights.  Under an ex gratia scheme, the Home Secretary will compensate an individual inter alia in compliance with the United Kingdom's international obligations.  The Home Secretary under this scheme has decided to give effect to Article 14 (6) of the United Nations Covenant on Civil and Political Rights but not to Article 5 para. 5 of the Convention. He submits that the possibility that compensation might be ordered by the court under Article 50 is no substitute for a substantive right to compensation under the domestic law where long-established criteria as to quantum of damages are liable to result in a more equitable remedy.  The object of compensation is to remedy material loss as well as to compensate for the suffering necessarily caused by excessive imprisonment or the loss of opportunity to end imprisonment.  It is submitted that the failure to provide an enforceable right has caused the applicant extra expense and material suffering and constitutes a breach of Article 5 para. 5 of the Convention. THE LAW The first applicant (Thynne) complains of the absence of any procedure under the law of the United Kingdom by which he can have reviewed by a court the continued lawfulness of his detention.  He invokes Article 5 para. 4 (Art. 5-4) of the Convention. The second applicant (Wilson) also complains that he was unable to have the lawfulness of his continued detention determined at reasonable intervals by a court and, further, that he was unable to challenge the lawfulness of his re-detention before a court as required by Article 5 para. 4 (Art. 5-4) of the Convention.  He further complains under Article 5 para. 5 (Art. 5-5) of the Convention that he has no enforceable right to compensation under the law of the United Kingdom in respect of his complaints. The third applicant (Weeks) complains that his re-detention in 1985 was in breach of Article 5 para. 1 (Art. 5-1) of the Convention since there existed no sufficient causal connection between his original conviction in 1966 and the decision to re-detain him for breach of a condition of his licence.  He further alleges a breach of Article 5 para. 4 (Art. 5-4) in that he was unable to take proceedings to challenge the lawfulness of his detention.  Finally, he alleges a breach of Article 5 para. 5 (Art. 5-5) on the ground that he has no enforceable right to compensation under United Kingdom law.  In particular, he complains that he was unable to obtain compensation before the courts of the United Kingdom on the basis of the judgment of the European Court of Human Rights that there was a breach of Article 5 para. 4 (Art. 5-4) of the Convention in his case. The fourth applicant (Gunnell) complains under Article 5 para. 4 (Art. 5-4) that he was unable to challenge before a court the lawfulness of his recall on 19 February 1983. All four applicants emphasise that they were given a discretionary life sentence as compared with a fixed-term sentence because it was considered necessary to protect the public.  They contend that such a sentence falls into the special category of sentences recognised by the European Court of Human Rights in the Weeks case (Eur.  Court H.R., judgment of 2 March 1987, Series A no. 114) attracting the safeguards of Article 5 para. 4 (Art. 5-4) of the Convention. The relevant parts of Article 5 (Art. 5) of the Convention read as follows: ""1.     Everyone has the right to liberty and security of person.  No one shall be deprived of his liberty save in the following cases and in accordance with a procedure prescribed by law: (a)     the lawful detention of a person after conviction by a competent court; ... 4.      Everyone who is deprived of his liberty by arrest or detention shall be entitled to take proceedings by which the lawfulness of his detention shall be decided speedily by a court and his release ordered if the detention is not lawful. 5.      Everyone who has been the victim of arrest or detention in contravention of the provisions of this Article shall have an enforceable right to compensation."" The Government refer to the decision of the European Court of Human Rights in the Weeks case (loc. cit.).  The Court held that in cases of life sentences falling into a special category, a prisoner was entitled to apply to a court-like body to have the lawfulness of his detention following recall and of continuing detention reviewed. The Government however contend that the facts of the cases Thynne, Wilson and Gunnell place them in a wholly different category from that of the first Weeks case.  It is clear from the court decisions that the life sentences imposed in these cases involved punishment as a significant element and that the gravity of the offence was a continuing and unchanging reason for the applicants' re-detention after release or, as in the case of Thynne, his continued detention. The Government therefore submit that it follows from the case-law of the Commission and Court that the requirement of Article 5 para. 4 (Art. 5-4) is incorporated in the decision of the trial court and any subsequent appeal against its decision. As regards the present application brought by Weeks the Government submit that life prisoners who are released on licence, are, as an important condition of the licence, subject to supervision by a probation officer.  Such monitoring is only possible if the licencee maintains regular contact with the probation officer.  It follows that the applicant's re-arrest in May 1985 is consistent with the objectives of the sentencing court which were that the applicant should be subject to continuing supervision even after release from prison.  It was thus in conformity with Article 5 para. 1 (Art. 5-1) of the Convention. As regards the applicant Weeks's complaint under Article 5 para. 4 (Art. 5-4) , the Government observe that the circumstances of his recall in 1985 were wholly different from those in 1977.  It is submitted that recall for a breach of a licence condition, as opposed to determination by the Secretary of State that he was a danger to the public does not place him in a special category so as to attract the safeguards of Article 5 para. 4 (Art. 5-4) of the Convention. Finally, with regard to the complaints made under Article 5 para. 5 (Art. 5-5) in the cases of Wilson and Weeks, the Government contend that no right to compensation arises under this provision where the detention is lawful within the meaning of Article 5 para. 1 (Art. 5-1) of the Convention. The Commission considers, in the light of the parties' submissions, that the applications raise complex issues of law and fact under the Convention, the determination of which should depend on an examination of their merits.  It follows that they cannot be rejected as manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 27 para. 2 (Art. 27-2) of the Convention. For these reasons, the Commission DECLARES THE APPLICATION ADMISSIBLE without prejudging the merits of the case. Deputy Secretary to the Commission      President of the Commission (J.

KRÜGER, Secretary to the Commission Having regard to Article 25 (Art. 25) of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms; Having regard to the application introduced on 2 March 1987 by Tracey Jane CHURCHILL against the United Kingdom and registered on 11 May 1987 under file No. 12936/87; Having regard to the report provided for in Rule 40 of the Rules of Procedure of the Commission; Having deliberated; Decides as follows: THE FACTS The applicant is a British citizen born in 1966 and is resident in Teignmouth, Devon.  The facts as submitted by the applicant may be summarised as follows. The applicant gave birth to a son A. on 2 February 1985. She was at that time living with a boyfriend in sub-standard and inadequate accommodation.  Shortly after A.'s birth, his name was entered on the local authority's At Risk register as he was failing to thrive.  The applicant attributed the problems of that period to their unsatisfactory accommodation.  The applicant and A. were visited regularly by a social worker, who from June 1985 was a Mr.  P. In July 1985, the applicant and her boyfriend moved to a better guest house.  During the move, A. was looked after by the applicant's mother.  On 28 July the applicant took A. to hospital, where it was discovered that he had a fractured arm.  On 29 July 1985 Mr.  P. informed the applicant that the local authority were applying for a care order in respect of A. and the same day the local authority obtained a Place of Safety Order.  On release from the hospital on 13 August, A. was placed with temporary foster parents and the applicant visited A. 2-3 times per week.  On 18 September 1985, the care proceedings in respect of A. were dismissed, as there was no conclusive evidence that the injury had been deliberately caused or even if it had, whether it had occurred at a time when A. had been living with the applicant. A. returned to the applicant's care following the hearing and at the end of October 1985 they moved to live with the applicant's mother.  Since her mother's home was too small, the applicant was on 31 December 1985 placed in bed and breakfast accommodation, her landlady being a foster mother with the social services.  The purpose of this placement was to help the applicant acquire better parenting skills.  The local authority also appointed a family aid to provide the applicant with support. In April 1986, the family aid noticed a mark on A.'s chest (allegedly a cigarette burn) and reported this to the local authority, which on 7 April 1986 obtained a Place of Safety Order in respect of A. and placed A. with foster parents.  The applicant had daily access to A.  On 23 May 1986 the applicant gave birth to her second child H., a daughter.  While still in hospital, the applicant was visited by Mr. P., the social worker dealing with A. and was persuaded to sign a form in which she acknowledged her ultimate responsibility for any injury to A. and agreed to go to live in a mother and baby home in Bristol. On 30 May 1986, the applicant moved to the home in Bristol with H.  On 4 June 1986, the local authority made A. a ward of court and A. was sent to join the applicant on 12 June 1986. After 2 1/2 months in the home, the applicant and her children were placed in an independent flat within the home for her to develop further her ability to cope for herself.  However, in October 1986, the local authority apparently became concerned about the applicant's ability to cope with both children.  Mr.  P. advised the applicant to place A. in foster care until H. was older.  When the applicant refused, the local authority decided to recommend to the Court that A. be placed with long-term foster parents with a view to adoption.  The local authority also made H. a ward of court. On 13-14 November 1986, the local authority's application concerning A. came before the Court.  The Court heard evidence from the family aid, the social worker dealing with A., and the matron of the mother and baby home on behalf of the local authority and an independent social worker and a worker from A.'s nursery on behalf of the applicant.  The applicant was present and represented by solicitor and counsel. The Court gave its decision on 14 November 1986 and the counsel's note of the judgment records the following reasoning: ""Mr.  P. <the social worker> gave evidence pointing out the fears of the local authority if both children were with the mother.  The family aid Mrs.  W. also expressed anxiety.  But the greatest possible assistance given to me in this case was from Mrs.  C. <the matron> who gave a full report from St Johns.  Maybe not all that report is from her own knowledge but she has extensive first hand knowledge during the 5 to 6 months that the family have been at St Johns. Mrs.  C. is well disposed towards the mother but had to say that there was a risk in allowing both children back with the mother and that she thought this was unacceptable.  She recited matters giving her cause for concern, and when cross examined, forceably but fairly, she remained quite adamant that such a position was unacceptable.  Mrs.  C. was reluctant to give this evidence as clearly the object of St Johns is to fit mothers to succeed and she is saying in effect that she and St Johns have failed in this case.  No one wants to acknowledge failure.  She was a most impressive witness, and without evidence to the contrary she has given advice that I really must accept. There were 2 witnesses called on behalf of the mother, Mrs.  B. from the nursery was one and even she had misgivings of the mother.  But even so her opinion cannot carry anything like the weight of the evidence of Mrs.  C.  Mr.  C. <the social worker called on behalf of the applicant> acknowledged that his contact and knowledge of the family was very limited.  He acknowledged that Mrs.  C. knew more than he did.  He thought that if it was premature to return the children to the mother immediately he would recommend a further term at St Johns; but of course Mrs.  C.'s opinion is that a further period, whether it was 6 months or any other period, would not improve this mother. This mother can be a good mother but the trouble is, according to Mrs.  C. that looking after both children has been on many occasions too much for her.  A. is a demanding child and the mother has acknowledged that she cannot cope with him from time to time and she has had to give up at these times.  This was even in the cloister of St Johns, and I think that if she was away and on her own it would not be possible to afford such support as will be necessary to get her over her difficulties.  The mother says that she can cope with the assistance of a family aid, but in my view this is totally inadequate support, and even massive support would not be enough in this case.  Being a mother is a 24 hour a day job and however much help from friends and relatives she receives she will certainly be quite alone overnight.  She can cope with one child, and there will be less stress put upon her if she only has H.  She can certainly cope with H. and the relationship with this child is different to the mother's relationship with A.  The bond with H. is natural and more than one witness has said that the mother and A. bond is not that commonly found between mother and child.  Little if any spontaneous cuddling takes place there is little eye to eye contact, and the mutual smiles that are natural are absent, and she cannot provide sufficient stimulation for this boy.  This situation obtained even when A. was H.'s age. Mrs.  C. says that there is an unacceptable risk if the children are returned to the mother.  I accept that advice. It was argued forceably by Mr.  P. <applicant's counsel> that if I adopt the course that the Social Services asked me to take A. will go to a temporary Foster Home for the short term, and in the meanwhile long term foster parents will be found with a view to adoption, which must result in a minimum of 2 moves.  He has also said that possible placements may fail.  I am urged by him not to take this risk.  But the alternative is for the children to go with the mother, and in the light of the evidence of Mrs.  C. that there is a very real risk that the placement with the mother would break down because she cannot cope which would mean that A. would be removed at an age where it would be rather more traumatic. I think that the local authority should start the process of placement for adoption now and then the situation for A. would be much less advantageous."" The Court therefore decided that A. was to be placed in the care of the local authority, with leave to place him with long-term foster parents with a view to adoption.  The applicant was also refused access, save for terminal access in which to say goodbye to A. It was ordered that H. could continue to reside with the mother, with a care order to the local authority. The applicant's solicitors sought advice as to an appeal, but were informed by counsel that in light of the House of Lords decision of G v G (1985, WLR p. 647) such cases were practically unappealable. The applicant was accordingly advised that an appeal would have no prospect of success. COMPLAINTS The applicant complains of the decision of the Court to place A. in the care of the local authority and to terminate access.  She also complains that the local authority gave misleading evidence at the hearing of the Court on 13-14 November 1986.  She complains of a violation of her rights under Article 8 (Art. 8) of the Convention. THE LAW The applicant complains that she has been deprived of custody of and access to her son A.  She complains that the local authority gave misleading evidence to the Court on 13-14 November 1986 and invokes Article 8 (Art. 8) of the Convention. Article 8 (Art. 8) of the Convention provides that: ""1.  Everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life, his home and his correspondence. 2.  There shall be no interference by a public authority with the exercise of this right except such as is in accordance with the law and is necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security, public safety or the economic well-being of the country, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others."" The Commission finds that, in accordance with its established case-law, the decision to take the applicant's son into care and terminate access constituted an interference with the applicant's right to respect for her family life protected by Article 8 para. 1 (Art. 8-1) of the Convention (see e.g.  Eur.  Court H.R., W v. the United Kingdom judgment of 8 July 1987, Series A no. 121, p. 27, para. 59).  The Commission must therefore examine whether this interference is justified under Article 8 para. 2 (Art. 8-2) of the Convention, namely whether it is ""in accordance with the law"", pursues one or more of the legitimate aims enumerated in Article 8 para. 2 (Art. 8-2) and whether it is ""necessary in a democratic society"" for one or more of those aims. The Commission recalls that A. was placed in the care of the local authority after the local authority had made A. a ward of court and following a hearing in the High Court, where the judge found that there was an unacceptable risk if A. remained with the applicant.  The Commission accordingly finds that the decision, made pursuant to the court's common law wardship jurisdiction, was ""in accordance with the law"" and was made for the aim of protecting A.'s health and development. The question remains whether the decision was ""necessary"" within the meaning of Article 8 para. 2 (Art. 8-2) of the Convention.  The case-law of the Commission and the Court establishes that the notion of necessity implies that the interference corresponds to a pressing social need and that it is proportionate to the aim pursued.  Further, in determining whether an interference is necessary the Commission and the Court will take into account that a margin of appreciation is left to the Contracting States, who are in principle in a better position to make an initial assessment of the necessity of a given interference. When determining whether or not the placing of A. in care and terminating the applicant's access to him were necessary in the interest of A., the Commission observes that it is not its task to take the place of the competent national courts and make a fresh examination of all the facts and evidence in the case.  The Commission's task is to examine whether the reasons adduced to justify the interference at issue are ""relevant and sufficient"" (Eur.  Court H.R., Olsson judgment of 24 March 1988, Series A no. 130, para. 68). The Commission has accordingly examined the reasons given in the judgment of the Court on 13-14 November 1986. The Commission recalls that the applicant was present at the hearing and was represented by solicitor and counsel.  The applicant therefore had the possibility of putting forward any views which in her opinion would be decisive for the outcome of the case.  With regard to these facts, the Commission finds that the procedural requirements implicit in Article 8 (Art. 8-2) were satisfied since the applicant was involved in the decision-making process to a degree sufficient to provide her with the requisite protection of her interest (see e.g. Eur. Court H.R., W v. the United Kingdom, loc. cit. para. 100). As regards the decision of the Court to place A. into care and terminate access, the Commission recalls that the Court heard evidence from the family aid, the social worker dealing with A. and the matron of the mother and baby home on behalf of the local authority, and an independent social worker and a worker from A.'s nursery on behalf of the applicant.  The Court found that the applicant was unable to cope with both children, and that help from a family aid or her family would not be enough to remedy her problems.  The Court concluded that there was thus an unacceptable risk if both children were returned to the applicant and so ordered that A. who had already suffered two injuries of unknown origin and with whom the applicant had been found to have particular problems, should be placed in care.  The Court further considered that if A. had to be removed from the applicant at a later age, it would be more traumatic for him.  In these circumstances, the Commission finds the decision was supported by ""relevant and sufficient"" reasons. The Commission therefore finds that, bearing in mind the margin of appreciation accorded to the domestic authorities, the interference in the present case was justified as being ""necessary in a democratic society"" for the protection of health and for the protection of rights of others. It follows that the application is manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 27 para. 2 (Art. 27-2) of the Convention. For these reasons, the Commission DECLARES THE APPLICATION INADMISSIBLE. Secretary to the Commission        President of the Commission (H.C. KRÜGER)                     (C.A. NØRGAARD)",,

AUSTRIA (Application no. 8695/79) JUDGMENT STRASBOURG 28 October 1987 In the Inze case [*] , The European Court of Human Rights, sitting, in accordance with Article 43 (art. 43) of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (""the Convention"") and the relevant provisions of the Rules of Court, as a Chamber composed of the following judges: Mr. J. Cremona , President , Mr. Thór Vilhjálmsson , Mr. G. Lagergren , Mr. F. Gölcüklü , Mr. F. Matscher , Mr. L.-E. Pettiti , Mr. R. Bernhardt , and also of Mr. M.-A. Eissen , Registrar , and Mr. H. Petzold , Deputy Registrar , Having deliberated in private on 25 April and 25 September 1987, Delivers the following judgment, which was adopted on the last-mentioned date: PROCEDURE 1.   The case was referred to the Court by the European Commission of Human Rights (""the Commission"") and by the Government of the Republic of Austria (""the Government"") on 14 May and 16 July 1986, respectively, within the period of three months laid down by Article 32 § 1 and Article 47 (art. 32-1, art. 47) of the Convention. The case originated in an application (no. 8695/79) against the Republic of Austria lodged with the Commission on 20 June 1979 by Mr. Maximilian Inze, an Austrian national, under Article 25 (art. 25). The Commission’s request referred to Articles 44 and 48 (art. 44, art. 48) and to the declaration whereby Austria recognised the compulsory jurisdiction of the Court (Article 46) (art. 46); the Government’s application referred to Article 48 (art. 48). Their object was to obtain a decision as to whether the facts of the case disclosed a breach by the respondent State of its obligations under Article 14 of the Convention, taken together with Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (art. 14+P1-1). 2.   In response to the enquiry made in accordance with Rule 33 § 3 (d) of the Rules of Court, the applicant stated that he wished to take part in the proceedings pending before the Court and designated the lawyer who would represent him (Rule 30). 3.   The Chamber of seven judges to be constituted included ex officio Mr. F. Matscher, the elected judge of Austrian nationality (Article 43 of the Convention) (art. 43), and Mr. R. Ryssdal, the President of the Court (Rule 21 § 3 (b)). On 5 June 1986, the President drew by lot, in the presence of the Registrar, the names of the five other members, namely Mr. Thór Vilhjálmsson, Mrs. D. Bindschedler-Robert, Mr. G. Lagergren, Mr. R. Bernhardt and Mr. J.A. Carrillo Salcedo (Article 43 in fine of the Convention and Rule 21 § 4) (art. 43). 4.   Having assumed the office of President of the Chamber (Rule 21 § 5), Mr. Ryssdal consulted, through the Registrar, the Agent of the Government, the Delegate of the Commission and the lawyer for Mr. Inze regarding the need for a written procedure (Rule 37 § 1). On 8 July 1986, he decided, having particular regard to their concurring statements, that it was not necessary for memorials to be filed and reserved the further procedure. On 2 March 1987, after consulting, through the Registrar, the Agent of the Government, the Delegate of the Commission and the lawyer for the applicant, the President directed that the oral proceedings should open on 23 April 1987 (Rule 38). He had previously granted the applicant’s lawyer leave to use the German language in the proceedings (Rule 27 § 3). On 1 April, the Commission submitted several documents. On 6 April, the applicant filed with the registry his claims for just satisfaction under Article 50 (art. 50) of the Convention. As Mr. Ryssdal was unable to attend the hearing, Mr. Cremona, the Vice-President of the Court, acted as President of the Chamber (Rules 9 and 21 § 5). 5.   The hearings were held in public at the Human Rights Building, Strasbourg, on the appointed day. Immediately before they opened, the Court had held a preparatory meeting. There appeared before the Court: - for the Government Mr. H. Türk , Legal Adviser, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Agent , Mr. N. Okresek , Federal Chancellery, Mrs. I. Djalinous , Ministry of Justice, Advisers ; - for the Commission Mr. S. Trechsel , Delegate ; - for the applicant Mr. H. Walther , Rechtsanwalt, Counsel . The Court heard their addresses and their replies to its questions. The Agent of the Government and counsel for the applicant filed a number of documents. 6.   On 12 August and 17 September respectively, the Registrar received the observations of the Government and of the Commission on the question of the application of Article 50 (art. 50) of the Convention in the present case. 7.   Subsequently, Mrs. Bindschedler-Robert and Mr. Carrillo Salcedo, who were prevented from taking part in the final deliberations on 25 September 1987, were replaced by Mr. F. Gölcüklü and Mr. L.-E. Pettiti, substitute judges (Rules 22 § 1 and 24 § 1). AS TO THE FACTS I.   THE PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE 8.   The applicant, who was born out of wedlock in 1942, is an Austrian citizen and resides at Stallhofen, Carinthia. 9.   Until 1965, the applicant lived on a farm at St. Bartlmä, Carinthia, which had belonged first to his maternal grandmother and then to his mother, Theresia Inze. When his mother married Mr. Rudolf Fischer, the applicant remained in the house not only with his grandmother and his mother, but also with her husband and subsequently with their son, Manfred Fischer, who was born in wedlock in 1954. At the age of 23, he left the farm and later he married and settled down a few kilometers away. The applicant’s mother died intestate on 18 April 1975 and left as her heirs, apart from the applicant, her husband and her second son. According to the provisions of the Civil Code, the widower was entitled to a one-fourth part of the inheritance (Article 757) and each of the sons (irrespective of their illegitimate or legitimate birth) to three-eighths thereof (Articles 732 and 754). In proceedings commenced ex officio before the Klagenfurt District Court (Bezirksgericht), the applicant, his step-father and his half-brother stated that they were willing to accept these shares. The District Court decided on 31 March 1976 that the declarations of acceptance were valid. 10.   However, the farm in question was subject to the special regulations in the Carinthian Hereditary Farms Act of 1903 (Erbhöfegesetz, Provincial Law Gazette, no. 33/1903, ""the Provincial Act"") providing that farms of a certain size may not be divided in the case of hereditary succession and that one of the heirs must take over the entire property and pay off the other heirs (see paragraph 25 below). The applicant had claimed on 8 August 1975 that he should be called to take over his mother’s farm as he was the eldest son. He later submitted that the regulation giving precedence to legitimate children had in the meantime been abrogated, and that both his step-father and his half-brother were in any event excluded as being unfit to work the farm, under section 7(4) of the Provincial Act (see paragraph 25 below). A. Classification of the farm 11.   On 28 April 1976, the District Court held a hearing in the presence of the parties. On 26 August, it appointed an expert to submit an opinion concerning the following matters: first, the classification of the farm as a ""hereditary farm"" within the meaning of the Provincial Act; second, its value for the purpose of determining the sums to be paid to the ceding heirs; and third, the conditions of its exploitation since the death of the applicant’s mother. 12.   The opinion, dated 1 October 1976, was filed with the court on 27 October. According to the expert, the farm was subject to the provisions of the Provincial Act, and its value was 331,040 Austrian schillings (ATS). However, the property was in a very bad condition and could not by itself provide a sufficient livelihood for a family. After the previous owner’s death, it had been worked mainly by her widower, who had kept only a few cattle and used all the land for pasture. The grassland had partly run wild and the fields had no longer been tilled. 13.   After a further hearing on 18 January 1977, the court decided on 25 January that the property had the character of a ""hereditary farm"" and fixed its value, in accordance with the expert opinion, at 331,040 ATS. This decision became final, as none of the parties appealed. B. Determination of the heir 14.   The question of the determination of the heir entitled to take over the farm, including the applicant’s claim that his step-father and half-brother should be excluded for this purpose, was referred to the Klagenfurt Regional Court (Landesgericht) in accordance with section 7(4) of the Provincial Act (see paragraph 25 below). The District Court communicated its file to the Regional Court on 20 July 1977. After a hearing scheduled to take place on 16 January 1978 had been cancelled, the Regional Court returned the file to the District Court on 17 January 1978, with the request to take further evidence relating to the ability of the applicant’s half-brother to work the farm. The expert opinion was therefore to be supplemented in this respect, and the District Court was asked to add its own legal opinion when re-submitting the file (section 7(4) of the Provincial Act; see paragraph 25 below). 15.   The District Court then ordered a supplementary expert opinion which was lodged on 6 April 1978. It stated that the conditions of the exploitation of the farm had further deteriorated, some lands having been left to a motor-cross club and some to a neighbour who had deposited various construction materials there. It was therefore hardly possible to speak of an orderly exploitation of the farm. As regards the ability of the applicant’s half-brother to run the farm at the same time as continuing with his job as an unskilled worker, the expert answered in the affirmative. Not very much was required to be done on the farm and his workplace was not so far away as to prevent his daily presence on the property. 16.   At a hearing held on 31 January 1979, after several postponements, the parties failed to arrive at any agreement as to who should take over the farm even just for the duration of the proceedings, the applicant’s step-father and half-brother being opposed to the appointment of a curator. 17.   The District Court re-submitted the file to the Regional Court in February 1979. The Regional Court decided on 25 June 1979 to declare the applicant’s claim inadmissible in so far as he sought a ruling that his step-father was excluded from taking over the farm, since the latter had not in fact maintained that he was entitled to do so. As regards the claim for exclusion of the applicant’s half-brother, the Regional Court found that he was neither prevented by his profession from working the farm, nor incapable of doing so at the same time as continuing with his job. Furthermore, he could not be held responsible for the negligent exploitation since his mother’s death because it was his father who had run the farm in the meantime. 18.   The applicant appealed against this decision to the Graz Court of Appeal (Oberlandesgericht), claiming that certain evidence had been disregarded by the Regional Court when refusing the exclusion of his half-brother. He also submitted that the provision in section 7(2) of the Provincial Act giving precedence to legitimate children (see paragraph 25 below) had been abrogated by the new version of Article 754 § 1 of the Civil Code, enacted in 1970, and by Article 14 (art. 14) of the European Convention on Human Rights. He requested the court to submit the question of the constitutionality of the provision to the Constitutional Court (Verfassungsgerichtshof). 19.   The Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal on 26 September 1979. After confirming the Regional Court’s finding that the applicant’s half-brother was not excluded, it stated that it had no doubts as to the constitutionality of the provision giving precedence to legitimate children. In its opinion, the provision had an objective justification because it was a peculiarity of the rural family and economic structure that legitimate children lived with the family on the farm, whereas illegitimate children were not infrequently brought up elsewhere and therefore did not have the same close link with the farm as legitimate children. This was also the situation in the present case. The Court of Appeal therefore saw no reason to submit the issue of constitutionality to the Constitutional Court. 20.   The applicant appealed against this decision to the Supreme Court (Oberster Gerichtshof), adducing essentially the same arguments as before the Court of Appeal. The Supreme Court rejected the appeal by a decision of 9 April 1980, on the ground that it was directed against a decision of the Court of Appeal confirming a previous decision of the Regional Court; in such a case, an appeal is admissible only when a decision is clearly contrary to law or inconsistent with the file, or when there has been a procedural defect entailing nullity of the proceedings. As to the first condition, the Supreme Court denied that section 7(2) of the Provincial Act had been abrogated by Article 754 § 1 of the Civil Code, as amended. The Supreme Court also held that there was no reason to submit the matter to the Constitutional Court, on the following grounds. As regards the conformity of section 7(2) with the constitutional provision in Article 14 (art. 14) of the Convention, Article 14 (art. 14) was applicable only in relation to the enjoyment of the rights and freedoms set forth in the Convention. In its opinion, the Convention did not deal with the question of hereditary succession, and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (P1-1), which secured the right to the peaceful enjoyment of possessions, did not exclude regulations providing for different rules of succession according to birth in wedlock or out of wedlock. Furthermore, there was no doubt as to the compatibility of section 7(2) with the constitutional principle of equality. This principle required that legislation make no legal distinction based on the personal status of an individual unless this was justified by objective reasons. The impugned regulations in the Provincial Act did not, however, appear to be unjustified. Similar provisions also existed in the provincial legislation of Tyrol (Höfegesetz) and in the federal legislation for the other provinces (Anerbengesetz) and these limited illegitimate children’s rights even further, in that they could take over a hereditary farm only if they had been brought up on it. The preparatory materials on this legislation showed that the precedence accorded to legitimate children was based on convictions of rural society. Neither was the regulation in question contradicted by attempts to assimilate the legal position of illegitimate children to that of legitimate children, because it reflected the special convictions and attitudes of the rural population which, among other things, also affected the legal position of the widower. Furthermore, the Supreme Court observed, the family was an important element of the legal organisation of human relationships. Having regard to all these circumstances, it could not be said that the regulations contained in the Provincial Act were not based on objective considerations. 21.   After the European Convention on the Legal Status of Children born out of Wedlock, of 15 October 1975, had entered into force in respect of Austria with effect from 29 August 1980, the applicant again appealed to the Supreme Court, asking it to reconsider its decision of 9 April 1980. Article 9 of this Convention provides that ""a child born out of wedlock shall have the same right of succession in the estate of its father and its mother and of a member of its father’s or mother’s family, as if it had been born in wedlock"". However, Austria ratified that Convention with the following reservation: ""In pursuance of Article 14 § 1 of the Convention, the Republic of Austria reserves the right not to accord to a child born out of wedlock, as provided for in Article 9 of the Convention, the same right of succession in the estate of its father and of a member of its father’s family, as if it had been born in wedlock."" On 6 October 1980, the Supreme Court rejected the appeal as inadmissible, having regard to the binding effect of its previous final decision and to the absence of a legal possibility to re-open the procedure. C. Settlement reached between the applicant and his half-brother 22.   The first-instance proceedings were resumed in October 1981. On 12 October, a judicial settlement was reached between the applicant and his half-brother whereby the applicant renounced any claim to take over his mother’s hereditary farm, which would pass to his half-brother. In return, he was to receive a certain piece of land which had been promised to him by his mother during her lifetime, but no other compensation. The judicial proceedings in the hereditary case were then terminated on 31 December 1981 by the transfer (Einantwortung) of the title to the whole farm to the applicant’s half-brother. 23.   The implementation of the above settlement was left to subsequent agreement between the parties, which they concluded on 26 May 1982. However, the separating-off of the piece of land, which consisted of forest, assigned to the applicant under the agreement still required the approval of certain administrative authorities, including in particular the competent forestry authority, having regard to the provisions of the Carinthian Provincial Forestry Act (Provincial Law Gazette, no. 77/1979). Certain difficulties arose in this respect. The piece of land was not sufficiently large for its separating-off to be permissible under the above Act except in the case of a predominant public interest, the existence of which the authority denied. The difficulties were apparently overcome after the Constitutional Court had in a different case found the relevant provisions of the Carinthian Provincial Forestry Act to be unconstitutional. The land was then registered in the applicant’s name in the official land register. This has been confirmed in an extract from the land register, dated 13 January 1984. II.  THE RELEVANT LEGISLATION A. Civil Code 24.   The relevant provisions of the Civil Code read as follows (translation from German): Article 545 ""Capacity to inherit can be determined only when the estate actually passes. This is generally when the de cuius dies (Article 703)."" Article 547 ""Once he has accepted the inheritance, the heir represents the de cuius in respect of the estate. Both shall be regarded as being one and the same person as regards third parties. Until the heir has accepted the inheritance, the estate shall be treated as if it were still in the deceased’s possession."" Article 550 ""Where there is more than one heir, they shall be regarded, in respect of their joint right to inherit, as being one person. Until the estate is transferred by court order, the heirs shall be jointly and severally liable. The extent to which they shall be liable thereafter is laid down in the chapter on taking possession of the estate."" B. The Carinthian Hereditary Farms Act 25.   The Carinthian Hereditary Farms Act, while leaving unaffected the general rules in the Civil Code on the determination of hereditary shares, regulates the attribution of these shares in cash or in kind. The following provisions of this Act are relevant (translation from German): Section 6 § 1 ""If the estate of the owner of a farm devolves on several persons, only one person, the principal heir (Anerbe), may inherit the farm and its equipment ..."" Section 7 ""The principal heir shall be determined according to law and the order which it prescribes for the devolution of estates. When there are several heirs and no agreement can be reached among them, they shall be called to take over the farm in the following order: (1) In general, male heirs shall take precedence over female, and older over younger heirs of the same sex; lots shall be drawn between heirs of the same age. Those more closely related shall, however, take precedence over those more distantly related. (2) Children related by blood shall always take precedence over adopted children and legitimate children over illegitimate children. ... (4) The following shall, in general, be excluded from taking over the farm: ... (b) persons who, by reason of a mental or physical disability, seem incapable of running the farm themselves, ... (d) persons who are prevented by their profession from managing the farm on the spot and working it in person. ... The decision regarding ... the existence of grounds of exclusion under paragraphs (b) to (e) shall be reserved to the court of first instance (Landesgericht and Kreisgericht), to which the District Court (Bezirksgericht) shall submit the file on the administration of the estate, together with its own opinion."" Section 8 ""When the estate is being divided, the farm (section 6) shall devolve on the principal heir, who shall become the estate’s debtor for the value of the farm free of charges."" Section 9 ""(1) The value of the farm shall be determined by agreement among the persons concerned. (2) If no such agreement can be reached, the court shall call on experts to make an assessment, shall hear the municipal council and the parties and shall determine on an equitable basis the value of the farm in such a way that the principal heir is not burdened with undue financial difficulties (wohl bestehen kann)."" Section 14 ""(1) The law on reserved portions (Articles 765 and 766 of the Civil Code) is not affected by the regulations on division of estates. (2)  The value of reserved portions shall be assessed with reference to the value of the farm, determined in accordance with section 9(2) ..."" 26.   To meet social changes that have occurred in recent years, the Federal Minister of Justice has prepared two Bills, one for all provinces except Tyrol and Carinthia and another concerning only Carinthia. The latter Bill was, in accordance with the usual practice, the subject of a consultation procedure in 1985. It is being amended in the light of the views expressed and will be laid before Parliament in the near future. Section 8 of the Bill reads as follows (translation from German): ""If the deceased was the sole owner of the farm, the person taking it over shall be determined according to law and the order which it prescribes for the devolution of estates. If there are several heirs and no agreement has been reached among them, they shall be called to take over the farm in the following order: 1.   Heirs who have been trained as farmers shall take precedence over those who have not. If several heirs have been trained as farmers, those who were brought up on the farm in question shall take precedence over those who were not. 2.   Children, including adopted children, of the deceased shall take precedence over a surviving spouse; a surviving spouse shall, however, take precedence over descendants who were not brought up on the farm and over other relatives."" ..."" The explanatory report states that this provision is designed to eliminate, inter alia, the disadvantages suffered by illegitimate and adopted children as compared with legitimate children. PROCEEDINGS BEFORE THE COMMISSION 27.   The applicant applied to the Commission on 20 June 1979 (application no. 8695/79). He complained that he was discriminated against, on account of his illegitimate birth, in the enjoyment of property rights relating to his mother’s hereditary farm. He alleged a violation of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, taken in conjunction with Article 14 of the Convention (art. 14+P1-1). 28.   The Commission’s proceedings were adjourned from May 1982 to October 1984 because friendly settlement negotiations were taking place in Austria. Subsequently, on 5 December 1984, the Commission declared the application admissible. In its report of 4 March 1986 (Article 31) (art. 31), the Commission expressed the opinion (by six votes to four) that there had been a breach of Article 14 of the Convention, read in conjunction with Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (art. 14+P1-1). The full text of the Commission’s opinion and of the dissenting opinions contained in the report is reproduced as an annex to the present judgment. FINAL SUBMISSIONS MADE BY THE GOVERNMENT TO THE COURT 29.   At the hearing on 23 April 1987, the Government requested the Court to hold ""that in the present case the provisions of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (P1-1), whether taken alone or in conjunction with Article 14 (art. 14+P1-1) of the ... Convention, have not been violated and that, therefore, the facts underlying the dispute do not indicate any breach of the Convention by the Republic of Austria; and in eventu that the decision by the Court that there has been a breach of the Convention amounts in itself to adequate just satisfaction for the purposes of Article 50 (art. 50) of the Convention"". AS TO THE LAW I.   THE APPLICANT’S STATUS AS ""VICTIM"" (Article 25 of the Convention) (art. 25) 30.   According to the Government, the applicant had renounced any claim to his mother’s estate under the judicial settlement with his half-brother and his step-father concluded on 12 October 1981 (see paragraph 22 above). Furthermore, the value of the piece of land which he had received in exchange amounted roughly to the value of three-eighths of that estate. In consequence, he could no longer claim to be a ""victim"" of a breach of the Convention. The applicant and the Commission took the opposite view; they pointed out in particular that the applicant had been in a weak negotiating position when he accepted the settlement. 31.   The Court has jurisdiction to rule on this preliminary plea, since it was raised by the Government before the Commission at the admissibility stage (see, as the most recent authority, the Nölkenbockhoff judgment of 25 August 1987, Series A no. 123, p. 77, § 32). 32.   The word ""victim"" in Article 25 (art. 25) refers to the person directly affected by the act or omission at issue; and the existence of a violation is conceivable even in the absence of prejudice, prejudice being relevant only for the purposes of Article 50 (art. 50) (see, inter alia, the van der Sluijs, Zuiderveld and Klappe judgment of 22 May 1984, Series A no. 78, p. 16, § 37). Therefore, the fact that a judicial settlement, concluded between private parties on their own, may have mitigated the disadvantage suffered by the applicant does not in principle deprive him of his status as ""victim"". The position might have been otherwise if, for instance, the national authorities had acknowledged either expressly or in substance, and then afforded redress for, the alleged breach of the Convention (see, inter alia, the Eckle judgment of 15 July 1982, Series A no. 51, pp. 30-31, § 66). 33.   In any event, the applicant’s complaint was directed to the fact that, in the instant case, his illegitimate birth deprived him in law of any possibility of taking over his mother’s farm in the partition of her estate. This situation remains unchanged and it is only its financial consequences which have been alleviated by the judicial settlement. In addition, the settlement was concluded at a time when Mr. Inze could no longer hope to obtain the property, since the Supreme Court had already finally decided against him (see paragraphs 20 to 22 above). He was therefore in a position of inferiority, and accepted the settlement as the lesser of two evils. 34.   In these circumstances, the applicant can still claim to be a ""victim"" within the meaning of Article 25 (art. 25) of the Convention. II.   THE ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 14 OF THE CONVENTION, TAKEN TOGETHER WITH ARTICLE 1 OF PROTOCOL No. 1 (art. 14+P1-1) 35.   Mr. Inze claimed that, as a result of the application of section 7(2) of the Provincial Act (see paragraph 25 above), he had been a victim of a violation of Article 14 of the Convention, taken together with Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (art. 14+P1-1). As far as is relevant, these provisions read: Article 14 (art. 14) of the Convention ""The enjoyment of the rights and freedoms set forth in [the] Convention shall be secured without discrimination on any ground such as ... birth or other status."" Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (P1-1) ""Every natural or legal person is entitled to the peaceful enjoyment of his possessions ..."" A. Applicability 36.   According to the Court’s established case-law, Article 14 (art. 14) complements the other substantive provisions of the Convention and its Protocols. It has no independent existence, since it has effect solely in relation to the ""rights and freedoms"" safeguarded by those provisions. Although the application of Article 14 (art. 14) does not presuppose a breach of one or more of such provisions - and to this extent it is autonomous -, there can be no room for its application unless the facts of the case fall within the ambit of one or more of the latter (see, inter alia, the Abdulaziz, Cabales and Balkandali judgment of 28 May 1985, Series A no. 94, p. 35, § 71). The applicant did not allege a violation of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (P1-1), taken alone, and the Court does not find it necessary to examine this question ex officio; it suffices to ascertain whether his complaints fall within the ambit of this provision. 37.   The Government submitted that this was not the case. They relied on the Court’s Marckx judgment of 13 June 1979, according to which Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (P1-1) ""does no more than enshrine the right of everyone to the peaceful enjoyment of ‘his’ possessions, (...) consequently it applies only to a person’s existing possessions and ... does not guarantee the right to acquire possessions whether on intestacy or through voluntary dispositions"" (Series A no. 31, p. 23, § 50). 38.   The Court recalls that Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (P1-1) in substance guarantees the right of property (see, inter alia, the AGOSI judgment of 24 October 1986, Series A no. 108, p. 17, § 48). Like the Commission, the Court considers that the situation in the instant case is to be distinguished from that in the Marckx case. In the latter, the complaint concerned the potential right of the second applicant to inherit from the first applicant, who was still alive. Here, the applicant had already acquired by inheritance a right to a share of his deceased mother’s estate, including the farm, subject to a distribution of the assets in accordance with the Provincial Act. Under Articles 545, 547 and 550 of the Austrian Civil Code, on the death of the de cuius, the heirs automatically acquire their hereditary rights over his estate, which is vested in them pro indiviso (see paragraph 24 above). Furthermore, the heirs had already accepted the shares provided for by the Civil Code and the Klagenfurt District Court had decided on 31 March 1976 that the declarations of acceptance were valid (see paragraph 9 above). The estate was therefore the joint property of the applicant and his co-heirs, although none of them had an immediate right to a specific asset. 39.   According to the Government, the provisions of the Provincial Act governing the attribution of hereditary farms on intestacy (see paragraph 25 above) had two aims: to prevent the splitting up of a farm, by providing that it shall pass to only one of the heirs, who shall compensate the others; and to maintain the farm’s viability by determining the compensation in such a manner that the principal heir is not burdened with undue financial difficulties. The Court notes that the applicant did not challenge the system of hereditary farms as such, but only the criteria applicable to the choice of the principal heir. In this respect, section 7(2) of the Provincial Act gives precedence to legitimate over illegitimate children. Accordingly, in the instant case the farm in question went to the younger, legitimate, son, whereas the applicant was, on the sole ground of his illegitimate birth, deprived of any possibility of obtaining it. 40.   The Court thus concludes that the facts at issue fall within the ambit of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (P1-1) and that Article 14 of the Convention, taken together with that provision (art. 14+P1-1), is therefore applicable. B. Compliance 41.   For the purposes of Article 14 (art. 14), a difference of treatment is discriminatory if it ""has no objective and reasonable justification"", that is, if it does not pursue a ""legitimate aim"" or if there is not a ""reasonable relationship of proportionality between the means employed and the aim sought to be realised"" (see, inter alia, the Lithgow and Others judgment of 8 July 1986, Series A no. 102, pp. 66-67, § 177). The Contracting States enjoy a certain margin of appreciation in assessing whether and to what extent differences in otherwise similar situations justify a different treatment in law; the scope of this margin will vary according to the circumstances, the subject-matter and its background (ibid.). In this respect, the Court recalls that the Convention is a living instrument, to be interpreted in the light of present-day conditions (see, amongst various authorities, the Johnston and Others judgment of 18 December 1986, Series A no. 112, p. 25, § 53). The question of equality between children born in and children born out of wedlock as regards their civil rights is today given importance in the member States of the Council of Europe. This is shown by the 1975 European Convention on the Legal Status of Children born out of Wedlock, which is presently in force in respect of nine member States of the Council of Europe. It was ratified by the Republic of Austria on 28 May 1980, with a reservation (see paragraph 21 above) which is not relevant to the facts of the present case. Very weighty reasons would accordingly have to be advanced before a difference of treatment on the ground of birth out of wedlock could be regarded as compatible with the Convention (see, mutatis mutandis, the above-mentioned Abdulaziz, Cabales and Balkandali judgment, Series A n o 94, p. 38, § 78). 42.   The Government advanced the following arguments. The criteria for selecting the principal heir were a consequence of the fact that only one heir was entitled to take over a hereditary farm. Furthermore, those criteria were based on objective reasons; in particular, the precedence given to legitimate children corresponded to what could be presumed to be the deceased’s intentions. In any event, the provisions of section 7(2) of the Provincial Act only applied to intestate succession and an owner who objected thereto could always make a will. In addition, the birth criterion reflected the convictions of the rural population and the social and economic condition of farmers. Again, illegitimate children, unlike legitimate children, were usually not brought up on their parents’ farm and did not have close links with it. Finally, one had to bear in mind the special treatment reserved to the surviving spouse, who was normally entitled to stay on the farm and to be maintained by the principal heir. 43.   Like the Commission, the Court is not persuaded by the Government’s arguments. Most of them are based on general and abstract considerations - concerning such matters as the deceased’s intentions, the place where illegitimate children are brought up and the surviving spouse’s relations with his or her legitimate children - which may sometimes not reflect the real situation. For instance, Mr. Inze was brought up and had worked on the farm in question until the age of 23 (see paragraph 9 above). Those considerations cannot justify a rule of this kind. Whilst it is true that the applicant’s mother could have made a will in his favour, this does not alter the fact that, in the instant case, he was deprived by law of the possibility of taking over the farm on her death intestate. 44.   The Court also considers that the argument relating to the convictions of the rural population merely reflects the traditional outlook. The Government themselves have recognised the ongoing developments in rural society and have accordingly prepared a Bill which takes them into account. In future, the attribution of a hereditary farm is to be based on objective circumstances, notably training for running farms and the fact of having been brought up on the particular property (see paragraph 26 above). The Court wishes to make it clear that these proposed amendments cannot in themselves be taken as demonstrating that the previous rules were contrary to the Convention. They do however show that the aim of the legislation in question could also have been achieved by applying criteria other than that based on birth in or out of wedlock. 45.   The Court therefore concludes that there was a breach of Article 14 of the Convention, taken together with Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (art. 14+P1-1). III.  APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 50 (art. 50) OF THE CONVENTION 46.   Article 50 (art. 50) provides as follows: ""If the Court finds that a decision or a measure taken by a legal authority or any other authority of a High Contracting Party is completely or partially in conflict with the obligations arising from the ... Convention, and if the internal law of the said Party allows only partial reparation to be made for the consequences of this decision or measure, the decision of the Court shall, if necessary, afford just satisfaction to the injured party."" Mr. Inze claimed just satisfaction for pecuniary damage resulting from his inability to take over his mother’s farm and for costs and expenses. He made no claim for non-pecuniary damage and this is not a matter which the Court has to examine ex officio (see, mutatis mutandis, the Sunday Times judgment of 6 November 1980, Series A no. 38, p. 9, § 14). A. Damage 47.   The Court notes that, as a result of section 7(2) of the Provincial Act, the applicant had no possibility in this case of taking over his mother’s farm, since the precedence given to his half-brother excluded him from the list of prospective principal heirs (see paragraph 33 above). It is true that Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (P1-1) did not entitle the applicant to inherit the farm specifically. Nevertheless, he lost, because of the discrimination found by the Court, real opportunities of taking over the farm, which must be taken into account (see, amongst other authorities, mutatis mutandis, the Sporrong and Lönnroth judgment of 18 December 1984, Series A no. 88, p. 13, § 25). Although the judicial settlement of 12 October 1981 (see paragraph 22 above) may have somewhat alleviated the financial consequences of the violation found by the Court, it did not completely efface - and did not therefore provide sufficient reparation for - the initial disadvantage suffered by the applicant (see paragraphs 32-33 above). 48.   Mr. Inze’s original claims were based on an expert opinion, dated 18 April 1985, which proceeded on the assumption that he would have obtained his mother’s farm, but for the discrimination found by the Court. He subsequently put forward an alternative method which led to a figure of ATS 1,268,476.34. This represented the alleged market value of the farm in 1976 (ATS 1,455,000) less (a) the transfer value (ATS 197,481.83) of the legal shares due to his half-brother and his step-father (see paragraphs 9 and 13 above) and (b) the market value at that time (ATS 455,700) of the piece of land received under the judicial settlement (see paragraph 22 above). The relevant sums had been adjusted to take account of changes in the cost-of-living index up to January 1987. 49.   The Government questioned both this method of calculation and its results. They put forward an alternative method, proposed by the Federal Ministry of Finance. In their opinion, if the Provincial Act had not applied, Mr. Inze would have been entitled only to three-eighths of the market value of the entire farm (ATS 1,827,838 in 1985). His material loss would then have amounted only to the difference between his legal share (ATS 685,439.52) and the market value of the piece of land he finally obtained (ATS 607,600). 50.   The Commission’s Delegate disagreed with both methods of calculation, since they led not to equal treatment between Mr. Inze and his half-brother, but, respectively, to treatment that was either more favourable or more prejudicial to the former. In his opinion, the applicant’s compensation should be calculated by increasing his legal share in reasonable proportion to the surplus value which accrued to his half-brother. 51.   Without disregarding the fact that the discrimination found by the Court led to a certain financial imbalance between the applicant and his half-brother, the Court points out that the damage is in this case the applicant’s loss of opportunities (see paragraph 47 above). Such a loss does not readily lend itself to precise quantification (see the above-mentioned Sporrong and Lönnroth judgment, Series A no. 88, p. 14, § 27). Accordingly, the Court, taking all the relevant factors into account and, as required by Article 50 (art. 50), making an assessment on an equitable basis, awards Mr. Inze the sum of ATS 150,000. B. Costs and expenses 52.   Mr. Inze claimed the reimbursement of costs and expenses incurred in Austria (ATS 22,780 for lawyer’s fees in the succession proceedings, ATS 4,409 for sundry expenses and 2,539 for expert’s fees) and before the Convention institutions (ATS 95,857.15 for the Commission’s proceedings and ATS 38,493.95 for the Court’s). 53.   In accordance with its established case-law, the Court must ascertain whether the costs and expenses claimed were actually incurred, necessarily incurred and reasonable as to quantum. 54.   As to the costs in Austria, the Court accepts that at least the lawyer’s and the expert’s fees were actually incurred. Moreover, although the Government contended that the presence of a lawyer in the succession proceedings was not in principle necessary, the Court considers that certain of the issues raised (including the question of constitutionality) were complex and required professional assistance. In addition, it was not unreasonable to have recourse to the services of an expert, having regard to the technicality of real-estate matters (see the above-mentioned Sporrong and Lönnroth judgment, Series A no. 88, p. 17, § 39); in fact, the Government themselves also consulted specialists. In the absence of details as to the lawyer’s fees and sundry expenses, the Court awards the sum of ATS 23,000 for these items; to this should be added the ATS 2,539 for the expert’s fees. 55.   As regards the Commission’s proceedings, the applicant claimed ATS 5,067 for lawyer’s fees incurred before they were adjourned (see paragraph 28 above) and ATS 90,790.15 for fees incurred thereafter. For the proceedings before the Court, he sought ATS 38,493.95. 56.   The Court finds the first amount, which was not contested by the Government, to be reasonable and therefore allows it. As for the second and third amounts, the Government did not contest that the applicant had incurred liability to pay sums additional to those covered by the legal aid which he had received from the Council of Europe (see the Unterpertinger judgment of 24 November 1986, Series A no. 110, p. 16, § 36). However, both they and the Commission argued that the figures claimed were excessive. The Government questioned the way in which the applicant’s lawyer had calculated his fees, the amount of which was twice that provided for proceedings before the Austrian Supreme Court. In the view of the Commission’s Delegate, on the other hand, since the guidelines published by the Conference of the Austrian Bar Associations did not apply to the Convention institutions, the applicant’s lawyer could not be criticised in this respect. However, the Delegate agreed with the Government that short notes and letters written by the lawyer to Strasbourg should not have been charged in the same way as substantial submissions. In the circumstances of the case, the Court is unable to award the totality of the sums claimed. It considers, on an equitable basis, that the applicant is entitled, subject as provided below, to be reimbursed ATS 50,000 referable to the proceedings before the Commission after their adjournment and those before the Court. 57.   To recapitulate, the sums allowed by the Court for costs and expenses total ATS 80,606. This amount has to be reduced by 4,500 French francs which the applicant has received, for laywer’s fees, by way of legal aid from the Council of Europe and increased by any turnover tax that may be due on the resulting balance or any part thereof. FOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT UNANIMOUSLY 1. Holds that the applicant can still claim to be a ""victim"" within the meaning of Article 25 (art. 25) of the Convention; 2. Holds that there has been a breach of Article 14 of the Convention, taken together with Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (art. 14+P1-1); 3. Holds that the respondent State is to pay to the applicant, for damage, ATS 150,000 (one hundred and fifty thousand Austrian Schillings) and, for costs and expenses, the sum resulting from the calculations to be made in accordance with paragraph 57 of the judgment; 4. Rejects the remainder of the claim for just satisfaction. Done in English and in French, and delivered at a public hearing in the Human Rights Building, Strasbourg, on 28 October 1987.

SWEDEN (Application no. 10426/83) JUDGMENT STRASBOURG 27 October 1987 In the Pudas case [*] , The European Court of Human Rights, sitting, in accordance with Article 43 (art. 43) of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (""the Convention"") and the relevant provisions of the Rules of Court, as a Chamber composed of the following judges: Mr. R. Ryssdal , President , Mr. G. Lagergren , Mr. B. Walsh , Mr. R. Macdonald , Mr. C. Russo , Mr. J. Gersing , Mr. J. De Meyer , and also of Mr. M.-A. Eissen , Registrar , and Mr. H. Petzold , Deputy Registrar , Having deliberated in private on 25 March and on 24 September 1987, Delivers the following judgment, which was adopted on the last-mentioned date: PROCEDURE 1.   The case was brought before the Court by the European Commission of Human Rights (""the Commission"") on 13 March 1986, within the three-month period laid down by Article 32 § 1 and Article 47 (art. 32-1, art. 47) of the Convention. It originated in an application (no. 10426/83) against the Kingdom of Sweden lodged with the Commission on 30 March 1983 under Article 25 (art. 25) by a Swedish citizen, Mr. Bengt Pudas. The Commission’s request referred to Articles 44 and 48 (art. 44, art. 48) and to the declaration whereby Sweden recognised the compulsory jurisdiction of the Court (Article 46) (art. 46). The purpose of the request was to obtain a decision as to whether the facts of the case disclosed a breach by the respondent State of its obligations under Articles 6 § 1 and 13 (art. 6-1, art. 13). 2.   In response to the inquiry made in accordance with Rule 33 § 3 (d) of the Rules of Court, the applicant expressed the wish to take part in the proceedings before the Court and designated the lawyer who would represent him (Rule 30). 3.   The Chamber of seven judges to be constituted included, as ex officio members, Mr. G. Lagergren, the elected judge of Swedish nationality (Article 43 of the Convention) (art. 43), and Mr. R. Ryssdal, the President of the Court (Rule 21 § 3 (b)). On 19 March 1986, the President drew by lot, in the presence of the Registrar, the names of the five other members, namely Mr. J. Cremona, Mr. B. Walsh, Mr. R. Macdonald, Mr. C. Russo and Mr. J. Gersing (Article 43 in fine of the Convention and Rule 21 § 4) (art. 43). Mr. J. De Meyer, substitute judge, subsequently replaced Mr. Cremona, who was prevented from taking part in the consideration of the case (Rules 22 § 1 and 24 § 1). 4.   Having assumed the office of President of the Chamber (Rule 21 § 5), Mr. Ryssdal consulted, through the Registrar, the Agent of the Swedish Government (""the Government""), the Delegate of the Commission and Mr. Pudas’ lawyer regarding the need for a written procedure (Rule 37 § 1). On 16 June 1986, he directed that the said Agent and lawyer should each be entitled to file a memorial by 16 August and that thereafter the Delegate should have one month to lodge a memorial in reply. 5.   The Registrar received the applicant’s memorial on 6 August 1986. On 19 August, he received a letter dated 14 August from the Agent of the Government stating that they had nothing to add to the observations they had previously submitted to the Court in a letter of 11 April 1986. On 2 September, the Secretary to the Commission indicated that the Delegate did not intend to present any written observations. 6.   On 26 February 1987, the President set 23 March down as the date for the opening of the oral proceedings, having first consulted, through the Registrar, the Agent of the Government, the Delegate of the Commission and the lawyer for the applicant (Rule 38). 7.   The hearing was held in public at the Human Rights Building, Strasbourg, on the appointed day. Immediately before it opened, the Court had held a preparatory meeting. There appeared before the Court: - for the Government Mr. H. Corell , Ambassador, Under-Secretary for Legal and Consular Affairs, Ministry for Foreign Affairs, Agent , Mr. P. Löfmarck , Under-Secretary for Legal Affairs, Ministry of Transport and Communications, Mr. H. Berglin , Legal Adviser, Ministry for Foreign Affairs, Advisers ; - for the Commission Mr. Gaukur Jörundsson , Delegate ; - for the applicant Mr. G. Ravnsborg , Lecturer in Law at the University of Lund, Counsel . The Court heard addresses by Mr. Corell for the Government, by Mr. Gaukur Jörundsson for the Commission and by Mr. Ravnsborg for the applicant, as well as their replies to its questions. AS TO THE FACTS I.   PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE 8.   The applicant, Mr. Bengt Pudas, is a Swedish citizen born in 1959. He lives at Hedenäset, which is situated in the Municipality of Övertorneå and the County of Norrbotten, in the North of Sweden. 9.   On 1 February 1980, the County Administrative Board (länsstyrelsen) of Norrbotten granted him a taxi traffic licence, and, on 20 May, a licence to carry passengers and their goods on specified interurban routes (linjetrafik). The licences were expressed to be valid until further notice. 10.   The applicant commenced his combined taxi and interurban traffic business on 20 May 1980. Two vehicles (a Peugeot 505 - mainly for the taxi traffic; and a seven-seater Citroën - mainly for the interurban traffic) were used in the business, which occupied the applicant, his father and a third driver on a part-time basis. By way of interurban traffic, the applicant offered a service of two journeys a week at scheduled times. This service was available on request and had to be ordered one day in advance. A. County Traffic Company’s application to the County Administrative Board 11.   On 2 April 1981, the County Traffic Company of Norrbotten (länstrafiken i Norrbotten AB) (see paragraph 20 below) filed an application with the County Administrative Board (see paragraph 19 below) for a licence to provide interurban transport on routes including those covered by Mr. Pudas’ second licence. The County Traffic Company at the same time requested that this licence be revoked, as well as a licence held since 1973 by a certain Mr. Wälimaa. In support of its application, the Company submitted that two traffic services in two different regions were to be united into one regular service with a single time-table, to be provided by the bus service business owned by Mr. Wälimaa and others. The applicant opposed the revocation of his licence. B. Decision to revoke Mr. Pudas’ licence 12.   On 17 August 1981, the County Administrative Board granted the County Traffic Company a licence, valid as from 1 September 1981, to provide interurban transport of passengers and goods on the routes indicated in its request. In another decision on the same day, the Board revoked the applicant’s and Mr. Wälimaa’s licences for interurban traffic, inter alia on the following grounds: ""The plans for the future transport service offered by the County Company include a regular bus service which is to be created between the places in question. Such a plan will, in the opinion of the Board, enable a better network of routes to be created for the area and transport to be co-ordinated in one route. Bearing this in mind, it is the opinion of the Board that the transport service in the area will be improved in such a way that the licence applied for by the County Company cannot be refused. Consequently, the former licences, issued to (the applicant) and Mr. Wälimaa, shall be revoked."" By virtue of a subsequent order, Mr. Pudas’ licence was to cease to be valid as from the date on which the revocation of 17 August became final. Shortly thereafter, the County Traffic Company contracted out to the company owned by Mr. Wälimaa and others the running of a bus service on the routes covered by its new licence. C. Appeals by Mr. Pudas against the revocation of his licence 13.   The applicant lodged an appeal with the Board of Transport (transportrådet), in which he alleged, inter alia, the following. The County Traffic Company’s application for a licence for the routes covered by his licence had been motivated not by any public interest in improving the transport service, but by an arrangement between the Company and Mr. Wälimaa (see paragraphs 11 and 12 above). Only very serious reasons, such as misconduct of the licence-holder, could justify revocation. When revoking his licence, the County Administrative Board had failed to take due account of his interests. Finally, the transport service on the routes concerned was not likely to be improved simply by being carried out by Mr. Wälimaa and others instead of by himself. The Board of Transport rejected the appeal on 14 May 1982. 14.   Mr. Pudas thereupon lodged a further appeal with the Government (Ministry of Transport and Communications), in which he referred to his arguments submitted to the Board of Transport. 15.   The Government dismissed the appeal on 21 October 1982. In response to a further request from the applicant, the Government declined, on 13 January 1983, to review their previous decision. II.   RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW A. General description of the licence system 16.   The relevant law is to be found in the Act and the Ordinance of 1979 on Commercial Transport (yrkestrafiklagen 1979:559 - ""the 1979 Act"", and yrkestrafikförordningen 1979:871 - ""the 1979 Ordinance""). Section 4 in Chapter 1 of the 1979 Act defines commercial transport as a transport service of goods or passengers by car, truck or bus offered to the public for a fee. Such service may only be performed by persons possessing a transport licence (Chapter 2, section 1). B. Conditions for the issue of licences 17.   Under the 1979 Act (Chapter 1, section 5), there are three kinds of passenger transport licences, which can briefly be described as follows: - transport on request, where the vehicle, with a driver, is put at the customer’s disposal and the price is determined according to the customer’s use of it (beställningstrafik); - tourist transport, which comprises commissioned tours for sightseeing, etc. (turisttrafik); and - regular transport on defined routes within or between specified urban areas - interurban traffic (linjetrafik) -, where the vehicle is not put at the customer’s disposal. Only persons (physical or legal) deemed suitable to conduct the service may obtain a licence. In examining applications, such factors as professional skill and personal and economic circumstances are considered, with a view to ensuring that the transport is effected under safe conditions by economically stable undertakings (Chapter 2, section 3, of the 1979 Act). A further condition is that the intended service is deemed necessary and appropriate (Chapter 2, section 11). The reason for this is the overall objective of establishing an adequate transport network and preventing any harmful surplus service. This objective extends to ensuring that transport operators who work on days and at hours that are not profitable are not exposed to uncontrolled competition from others who only provide a service when profitable. The licensing authority makes licences to carry passengers on interurban routes subject to specific conditions, concerning such matters as routes and time-tables (Chapter 2, section 23, and Chapter 3, sections 5 and 6, of the 1979 Ordinance). The Board of Transport sets the rates to be charged (ibid., Chapter 3, sections 1 to 3). C. Organisation and administration of the transport system 18.   Norrbotten is one of the vast and sparsely populated counties in Sweden where an adequate transport service is not feasible unless publicly-funded transport is provided. It is estimated that an average of 50 per cent of passenger transport costs in Sweden are borne out of public funds and that this percentage is even higher in the Northern parts of the country. 19.   Licences to carry passengers on interurban routes are normally issued and revoked by the County Administrative Board. 20.   According to the Act of 1978 on ""Principals"" for various forms of public transport of passengers (Lag 1978 : 438 om huvudmannaskap för viss kollektiv persontrafik - ""the 1978 Act""), each county shall have a ""Principal"" (""huvudman"") responsible for the local and regional public traffic by road (section 1) and, in particular, for ensuring the availability of proper transport facilities at a cost which does not impose an undue burden on taxpayers. The Principal, which is constituted by the County Council (landstinget) and the local municipalities (kommunerna) together, has overall responsibility for public transport within the county. In some counties the Principal’s tasks are carried out by a public entity (kommunalförbund). However, in most counties, including that of Norrbotten, they are performed by a company, known as the County Traffic Company, which is wholly owned by the County Council and the municipalities. The Principal may either hold the licences itself or operate a system under which they are held by private transporters. In the former event, the Principal may provide the service under its own management or arrange for private persons to run the traffic under contract. Even where the licence-holder is a private transporter, he is dependent on funding from the Principal in order to cover deficits. D. Conditions for revocation of licences to carry passengers on interurban routes 21.   A licence must be revoked if it has been misused in such a way that the holder can no longer be deemed suitable to provide the service, though in less serious cases a warning may be issued; it must also be revoked if the service is not maintained (Chapter 3, sections 1 and 2, of the 1979 Act). A licence must also be revoked where, inter alia, a municipality or a Principal applies for a licence and establishes that the transport facilities in the area will probably be improved if it takes over the licence itself (Chapter 3, section 5, of the 1979 Act). In addition, a licence may be revoked, following an application by a prospective transporter, when there are good grounds to suppose that this will be conducive to the most rational organisation of transport. E. Remedies available against revocation of licences to carry passengers on interurban routes 22.   An appeal against any such decision by a County Administrative Board to revoke a licence lies to the Board of Transport. In its capacity as authority of final instance, the Government (Ministry of Transport and Communications) may review decisions by the Board. 23.   Generally speaking, the Swedish administration is not subject to supervision by the ordinary courts. Those courts entertain proceedings against the State only in contractual matters, on questions of extra-contractual liability and, under some statutes, in respect of administrative decisions. Judicial review of the administration’s acts is therefore primarily a matter for administrative courts. These courts comprise three levels: the county administrative courts (länsrätterna); the administrative courts of appeal (kammarrätterna); and the Supreme Administrative Court (regeringsrätten). They are composed of independent judges and enjoy, as a rule, wide powers which enable them not only to set aside administrative acts but also to vary or substitute them. This principle is subject to an important exception, in that no appeal may be made against decisions of the Government. There is, however, a limited possibility to file a petition with the Supreme Administrative Court for re-opening of the proceedings (resningsansökan) in respect of decisions of the Government as well as other authorities. Further particulars regarding this remedy appear in the Sporrong and Lönnroth judgment of 23 September 1982 (Series A no. 52, pp. 19-20, § 50). 24.   The civil liability of the State is dealt with in Chapter 3 of the Civil Liability Act 1972 (skadeståndslagen 1972:207). According to section 2, acts of public authorities may give rise to an entitlement to compensation in the event of fault or negligence. However, under section 7, an action for damages will not lie in respect of decisions taken by Parliament, the Government, the Supreme Court, the Supreme Administrative Court or the National Social Security Court. 25.   Finally, when a new licence has been granted, the former licence-holder may call on the new licence-holder to ""redeem"" the vehicles and other equipment used in his enterprise. Any such request must be lodged not later than two months after the revocation became effective. Redemption cases are dealt with by the Bus and Taxi Assessment Board in accordance with the provisions of a 1969 Ordinance (kungörelsen 1969 : 690 om buss-och taxivärderingsnämnden). This Board determines the scope of the redemption and the amount to be paid. The assets are to be given a value corresponding to what could be obtained on a sale under normal conditions. If the assessment would produce a manifestly unfair result, the amount may, however, be adjusted. The Board must give the parties the opportunity to state their case in writing or orally. The Board may also have an enquiry carried out by independent experts. The expenses of the proceedings are to be borne, as a rule, by the new holder of the licence. The Board is composed of a chairman and two other members. The chairman must be an experienced judge. PROCEEDINGS BEFORE THE COMMISSION 26.   In his application of 30 March 1983 to the Commission (no. 10426/83), Mr. Pudas complained that the revocation of his licence to transport persons on specified interurban routes violated Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (P1-1). Furthermore, he alleged that there had been a breach of Article 6 § 1 (art. 6-1) of the Convention as he had no possibility of having the revocation reviewed by a court. He also relied on Article 13 (art. 13), maintaining that he had no ""effective remedy"" against that decision. 27.   On 5 December 1984, the Commission declared admissible, as raising issues under Articles 6 and 13 (art. 6, art. 13) of the Convention, the applicant’s complaint that he had no remedy before a court in respect of the revocation of his licence. The remainder of the complaints were declared inadmissible. In its report of 4 December 1985 (Article 31) (art. 31), the Commission expressed the unanimous opinion that there had been a breach of Article 6 § 1 (art. 6-1) and that no separate issue arose under Article 13 (art. 13). The full text of the Commission’s opinion is reproduced as an annex to the present judgment. AS TO THE LAW I.   ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 6 § 1 (art. 6-1) OF THE CONVENTION 28.   The applicant complained that under Swedish law he did not have the possibility of having the revocation of his transport licence reviewed by a court. He alleged a violation of Article 6 § 1 (art. 6-1), which, as far as is relevant, provides: ""In the determination of his civil rights and obligations ..., everyone is entitled to a ... hearing ... by [a] tribunal ..."" 29.   In view of the submissions made, the first issue to be resolved is the applicability of this provision and, more particularly, whether the instant case involved the ""determination"" of a ""civil right"". A. Applicability of Article 6 § 1 (art. 6-1) 30.   According to the Court’s established case-law, Article 6 § 1 (art. 6-1) extends only to ""contestations"" (disputes) over ""civil rights and obligations"" which can be said, at least on arguable grounds, to be recognised under domestic law; it does not in itself guarantee any particular content for ""civil rights and obligations"" in the substantive law of the Contracting States (see, as the most recent authority, the W v. the United Kingdom judgment of 8 July 1987, Series A no. 121, pp. 32-33, § 73). 1. Existence of a ""contestation"" (dispute) over a ""right"" 31.   As to whether there was a ""contestation"" within the meaning of Article 6 § 1 (art. 6-1), regard should be had to the principles enunciated in the Court’s case-law, summarised in the Benthem judgment of 23 October 1985 (Series A no. 97, pp. 14-15, § 32): (a)   Conformity with the spirit of the Convention requires that the word ""contestation"" (dispute) should not be construed too technically and should be given a substantive rather than a formal meaning. (b)   The ""contestation"" (dispute) may relate not only to the actual existence of a right but also to its scope or the manner in which it may be exercised. It may concern both questions of fact and questions of law. (c)   It must be genuine and of a serious nature. (d)   The expression ""contestations sur (des) droits et obligations de caractère civil"" (disputes over civil rights and obligations) covers all proceedings the result of which is decisive for such rights and obligations. However, a tenuous connection or remote consequences do not suffice for Article 6 § 1 (art. 6-1): civil rights and obligations must be the object - or one of the objects - of the ""contestation"" (dispute); the result of the proceedings must be directly decisive for such a right. 32.   Before the Convention institutions, the applicant alleged that a secret agreement between the County Traffic Company and Mr. Wälimaa formed the background to the revocation of his licence and that there had been an abuse of power on the part of the authorities. He also pointed out that as a result of the revocation he lost an important part of his business and livelihood. 33.   The Government first observed that under the 1979 Act there was no right to obtain a licence of the kind at issue, in the sense that it would automatically be granted to anyone who satisfied certain conditions. Secondly, they argued, the licence concerned did not constitute a ""right"" for Mr. Pudas, since it was issued not for a fixed period of time but merely ""until further notice"" (see paragraph 9 above). Thirdly, they contended that the revocation of the licence depended essentially on an assessment of policy issues not capable of or suited to judicial control (see paragraphs 17 and 21 above). On this latter point, the Government referred to the van Marle and Others judgment of 26 June 1986 (Series A no. 101, p. 12, § 36). 34.   The Court agrees with the Commission that, on being granted a licence, the applicant acquired certain consequential rights. To begin with, subject to the possibility of its being revoked, the licence conferred a ""right"" on the applicant in the form of an authorisation to carry out a transport service in accordance with the conditions prescribed in it and laid down by domestic law (see paragraphs 9, 16 and 17 above). It is true that the licence did not specify the conditions on which it could be revoked and that the law allows a certain discretion as regards revocation, but it follows from generally recognised legal and administrative principles that the authorities did not have an unfettered discretion in this respect. The applicant could plausibly and arguably maintain that according to Swedish law he was entitled to continue his business under the licence. The Court notes that in his appeal to the Board of Transport, he contended the following (see paragraph 13 above): the County Traffic Company’s application to the County Administrative Board for a transfer of his licence was not motivated by any public interest in improving the transport service on the routes in question, but by an arrangement between the Company and another transport business; transport service was not likely to be improved if it were carried out by this other business rather than by his own. He was, as the Delegate of the Commission pointed out at the hearing, thus challenging not only the wisdom of the revocation as a matter of policy but also its lawfulness. In addition, the proceedings complained of were capable of leading - and did in the event lead - to confirmation of the decision being challenged, namely the revocation by the County Administrative Board of the applicant’s licence; they were therefore directly decisive for the right at issue. 2. Civil character of the right (a) Relevant principles 35.   According to the well established case-law of the Court, the concept of ""civil rights and obligations"" is not to be interpreted solely by reference to the respondent State’s domestic law and Article 6 § 1 (art. 6-1) applies irrespective of the status of parties, as of the character of the legislation which governs how the dispute is to be determined and the character of the authority which is invested with jurisdiction in the matter; it is enough that the outcome of the proceedings should be decisive for private rights and obligations (see notably the Deumeland judgment of 29 May 1986, Series A no. 100, p. 22, § 60, and the Baraona judgment of 8 July 1987, Series A no. 122, pp. 17-18, § 42). (b) Application of these principles in the instant case 36.   The Government contended that the provision of public transport services in Sweden carries the ""predominant stamp of a public-law activity"". Thus, the responsibility for ensuring the availability of proper transport facilities is placed by law on public authorities (see paragraphs 19-20 above). Administrative authorisation, the Government further submitted, is required to carry out the activities in question and such authorisation - as well as, where appropriate, its revocation - depends partly on a discretionary assessment, for example of the necessity and appropriateness of a given service on a given route. A licence, if granted, is normally subject to a number of conditions as to, for instance, the routes to be covered, the regularity of the service offered and the maximum rates to be charged. To the extent that it may be said that the applicant entered into contractual relationships with his customers, he was legally obliged to do so. In short, the applicant had to perform a service regulated in almost every detail by the public authorities. These regulations are provided for by law mainly with a view to securing the public interest of having a rational transport system (see paragraphs 16, 17 and 21 above). Finally, unlike the situation of a businessman operating in the private sector, a substantial, and often even a major, part of the licence-holder’s costs of running the business is covered out of public funds (see paragraph 18 above). 37.   In the Court’s view, however, these features of public law do not suffice to exclude from the category of civil rights under Article 6 § 1 (art. 6-1) the rights conferred on the applicant by virtue of the licence. The maintenance of the licence to which the applicant claimed to be entitled was one of the conditions for the exercise of his business activities. Furthermore, public transport services in Sweden are not ensured by a State monopoly but both by public bodies and by private persons (see paragraph 20 above). At least in the latter event, the provision of such services takes the form of a commercial activity. It is carried out with the object of earning profits and is based on a contractual relationship between the licence-holder and the customers. 38.   The dispute between Mr. Pudas and the Swedish authorities did therefore concern a ""civil right"" and Article 6 § 1 (art. 6-1) is thus applicable to the present case. B. Compliance with Article 6 § 1 (art. 6-1) 39.   The Government admitted that, should the Court find Article 6 § 1 (art. 6-1) to be applicable, the applicant was not afforded the safeguards it sets out. The Court nevertheless has to ascertain whether Mr. Pudas enjoyed the ""right to a court"", as guaranteed to him under Article 6 § 1 (art. 6-1) (see the Golder judgment of 21 February 1975, Series A no. 18, p. 18, § 36). 40.   The dispute in question was determined by the Government (Ministry of Transport and Communications) in its capacity as authority of final instance (see paragraph 22 above). The Government’s decision rejecting Mr. Pudas’ appeals against the revocation of his licence by the County Administrative Board was not open to review as to its lawfulness by either the ordinary courts or the administrative courts, or by any other body which could be considered to be a ""tribunal"" for the purposes of Article 6 § 1 (art. 6-1) (see paragraph 23 above). 41.   Admittedly, holders of an interurban traffic licence can challenge the lawfulness of a revocation by requesting the Supreme Administrative Court to re-open the proceedings. However, for the reasons set out in the Sporrong and Lönnroth judgment of 23 September 1982 (Series A no. 52, p. 31, § 86), this extraordinary remedy does not meet the requirements of Article 6 § 1 (art. 6-1). C. Conclusion 42.   There was accordingly a violation of Article 6 § 1 (art. 6-1). II.   ALLEGED BREACH OF ARTICLE 13 (art. 13) OF THE CONVENTION 43.   The applicant claimed that he was deprived of any ""effective remedy before a national authority"" in respect of the matters of which he complained. Having regard to its decision on Article 6 § 1 (art. 6-1), the Court, like the Commission, does not find it necessary to examine the case under Article 13 (art. 13); this is because its requirements are less strict than, and are here absorbed by, those of Article 6 § 1 (art. 6-1) (see the above-mentioned W v. the United Kingdom judgment, Series A no. 121, p. 37, § 86). III.  ALLEGED BREACH OF ARTICLE 1 OF PROTOCOL NO. 1 (P1-1) 44.   Before the Commission, the applicant alleged that the withdrawal of his interurban traffic licence, and the manner in which it was accomplished, constituted a violation of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (P1-1), which in substance guarantees the right of property. Although the Commission declared this claim inadmissible, the applicant maintained it in his memorial to the Court. However, he did not revert to the matter during the subsequent public hearing. In those circumstances, the Court considers that it is not called upon to examine whether it has jurisdiction to entertain the complaint under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (P1-1) and, if so, whether there has been a breach of this provision. IV.   APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 50 (art. 50) OF THE CONVENTION 45.   Article 50 (art. 50) of the Convention provides: ""If the Court finds that a decision or a measure taken by a legal authority or any other authority of a High Contracting Party is completely or partially in conflict with the obligations arising from the ... Convention, and if the internal law of the said Party allows only partial reparation to be made for the consequences of this decision or measure, the decision of the Court shall, if necessary, afford just satisfaction to the injured party."" By way of just satisfaction, Mr. Pudas sought financial compensation for prejudice allegedly suffered and reimbursement of costs and expenses. A. Damage 46.   The applicant claimed ""ten to fifteen times"" the sum of 70,000 Swedish crowns (SEK), together with interest, as ""compensation"" in respect of damage resulting from the revocation of his licence. 47.   As regards possible pecuniary damage sustained, the evidence submitted does not warrant the conclusion that, had Mr. Pudas been able to challenge the revocation of his licence before a tribunal, the decision would have been in his favour. Neither is it for the Court to inquire into the merits under Swedish law of the revocation. No award can therefore be made in respect of pecuniary damage. 48.   However, the Court considers that the applicant suffered, by reason of the absence of a court remedy, some non-pecuniary prejudice and that, contrary to the view of the Government and the Commission, sufficient satisfaction would not be provided solely by the finding of a violation. The Court accordingly awards financial compensation to Mr. Pudas under this head. Deciding on an equitable basis, it fixes the amount thereof at 20,000 SEK. B. Costs and expenses 49.   The applicant claimed in respect of costs and expenses: (a) 14,000 SEK for travel, effected by himself, his counsel (Mr. Andersson) and his personal adviser (Mr. Puranen), to the County Administrative Board in Luleå and to the Government offices in Stockholm for meetings with the Minister of Transport and Communications; (b) 3,100 SEK for Mr. Andersson’s fees in connection with his representation before the national authorities; (c) 3,000 SEK for ""research (compensation for travel and subsistence allowance)"", paid to Mr. Puranen; (d) 5,000 SEK for ""loss of ordinary income"" incurred by Mr. Puranen; (e) 126,000 SEK for lawyer’s fees (90 hours at 1,400 SEK per hour) paid in connection with his representation before the Strasbourg institutions. 50.   The Government expressed their readiness to reimburse, in the event of the Court finding a violation of the Convention, all costs and expenses reasonably incurred by the applicant in connection with his case. They contested, however, the first item on the ground that the expenses referred to had not been incurred for a purpose which fell ""within the sphere of examination by the Strasbourg organs"". They also took issue on the fourth item, since they did not see in what respect such costs had been incurred. Finally, as to the fifth item, they maintained that the claimed number of hours and the hourly rate were excessive. 51.   As to the first and fourth items - travel expenses and loss of income on the part of Mr. Puranen -, no evidence has been furnished showing that they involved costs necessarily incurred with a view to preventing or obtaining redress for the matter found by the Court to constitute a violation of Article 6 § 1 (art. 6-1) of the Convention. No compensation is therefore recoverable under these heads. 52.   On the other hand, the fees of Mr. Andersson and Mr. Puranen, set out in the second and the third heads of claim, were not contested by the Government. 53.   Nor was it disputed that the fifth item of expenditure, namely the legal fees paid in connection with the applicant’s representation before the Strasbourg institutions, was actually incurred. However, the Court, like the Government, is not convinced that these fees were all incurred necessarily and were reasonable as to quantum. In these circumstances, the Court is unable to award the totality of the amount claimed; it considers on an equitable basis that the applicant is entitled to recover as reasonable reimbursement for the fees in question the sum of 50,000 SEK, from which must be deducted the 2,720 French francs (FF) already received from the Council of Europe in respect of legal costs. FOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT UNANIMOUSLY 1. Holds that Article 6 § 1 (art. 6-1) of the Convention applied in the instant case; 2. Holds that the said Article 6 § 1 (art. 6-1) has been violated; 3. Holds that it is not necessary also to examine the case either under Article 13 (art. 13) of the Convention or under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (P1-1); 4. Holds that the respondent State is to pay to the applicant, in respect of non-pecuniary damage, 20,000 (twenty thousand) Swedish crowns and, in respect of costs and expenses, 56,100 (fifty-six thousand one hundred) Swedish crowns, less 2,720 (two thousand seven hundred and twenty) French francs to be converted into Swedish crowns at the rate applicable on the date of delivery of the present judgment; 5. Rejects the remainder of the claim for just satisfaction. Done in English and in French, and delivered at a public hearing in the Human Rights Building, Strasbourg, on 27 October 1987. Rolv RYSSDAL President Marc-André EISSEN Registrar In accordance with Article 51 § 2 (art. 51-2) of the Convention and Rule 52 § 2 of the Rules of Court, the separate opinion of Mr. De Meyer is annexed to the present judgment. R.R. M.-A.E. SEPARATE OPINION OF JUDGE DE MEYER (Translation) While concurring in the result, I very much regret that I cannot agree with certain parts of the supporting reasoning in the judgment. The reasons set forth in paragraphs 34 and 37 amply suffice to establish that ""the instant case involved the ‘determination’ of a ‘civil right’"" [1] . It was pointless to repeat, in paragraphs 30, 31 and 35, a number of general considerations already expressed in previous judgments, the more so as some of these considerations are seriously open to dispute. In particular, paragraph 30 once again contains the assertion that Article 6 § 1 (art. 6-1) of the Convention extends ""only to ‘contestations’ (disputes) over ‘civil rights and obligations’ which can be said, at least on arguable grounds, to be recognised under domestic law"". As shown recently in the cases of W, B, R and 0 v. the United Kingdom [2] , this unfortunate assertion, which was refuted beforehand by Judge Lagergren in the Ashingdane case [3] , is contested by at least six members of the Court. It was not repeated in the judgment on the Baraona case [4] . Neither should it have been repeated in the present case. Furthermore, the statements reproduced in paragraph 31 put too much weight on the word ""contestations"" (disputes), which appears only in the French text of Article 6 § 1 (art. 6-1) of the Convention and which has no equivalent in the English text. The latter refers, more generally, to the determination of rights and obligations and not only to decisions to be taken on ""contestations"" concerning rights and obligations. Excessive reliance on the notion of ""contestations"" may entail too narrow an interpretation and application of the principles which those who drafted the provisions concerned were attempting to define. Similarly, the requirement that the ""contestation"" must be ""genuine and of a serious nature"" may likewise have too restrictive an effect. If reference is to be made to previous judgments, what should not be forgotten above all is the statement made by the Court in 1968 in its judgment on the Wemhoff case : ""given that [the Convention] is a law-making treaty, it is ... necessary to seek the interpretation that is most appropriate in order to realise the aim and achieve the object of the treaty, not that which would restrict to the greatest possible degree the obligations undertaken by the Parties"" [5] .

C. A. NØRGAARD, President E. BUSUTTIL G. JÖRUNDSSON A. S. GÖZÜBÜYÜK A. WEITZEL J. C. SOYER G. BATLINER H. VANDENBERGHE Mrs.  G. H. THUNE MM.  F. MARTINEZ C. L. ROZAKIS Mrs.  J. LIDDY Mr.  J. RAYMOND, Deputy Secretary to the Commission Having regard to Article 25 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms; Having regard to the application introduced on 24 March 1986 by Eric CLOSTERLING against Sweden and registered on 29 May 1986 under file No. 12195/86; Having regard to the report provided for in Rule 40 of the Rules of Procedure of the Commission; Having deliberated; Decides as follows: THE FACTS The facts of the case, as they appear from the applicant's submissions, may be summarised as follows. The applicant is a Swedish citizen born in 1924 and resident at Norrköping. The applicant owns a property, Stg 2257 CD, on which he lives. On 28 October 1981 the Health Care Committee (hälsovårdsnämnden) of the Municipality of Norrköping rejected an application from the applicant for permission to install a water closet on his property. The applicant appealed to the County Administrative Board (länsstyrelsen) of the County of Östergötland, which rejected the appeal on 8 April 1982.  In its decision the Board found that further private water closets would create a sanitary risk in the area in question. The applicant appealed to the Administrative Court of Appeal (kammarrätten) of Jönköping which, on 25 May 1984, rejected the appeal.  In its judgment the Court noted that since 1 July 1983 Section 7 para. 2 of the Health Care Act (hälsoskyddslagen) required the permission of the Environmental and Health Care Committee (miljö-och hälsoskyddsnämnden) as a condition for the installation of a sewage system to which a water closet is connected.  However, in view of the plans of the municipality for the area in question as well as other circumstances, the Court considered that the applicant's request for such permission should not be granted. The applicant appealed to the Supreme Administrative Court (regeringsrätten), which, on 6 December 1985, refused to grant leave to appeal. In a letter of 20 August 1985 to the applicant a member of the Health Care Committee, in his capacity as the local chairman of the Conservative Party, stated that ""it is a breach of the law to bury the sewage on one's own property"".  According to the applicant, other members of the Committee had accused him of destroying the ground water. On 3 March 1986 the Environmental and Health Committee of Norrköping rejected a fresh application from the applicant for a permit to install a water closet with a closed system. COMPLAINTS The applicant complains that he is not allowed to install a water closet with a closed sewage system on his property, and he submits that members of the Health Care Committee have accused him of breaches of the law.  He alleges that Article 6 paras. 1 and 2 of the Convention have been violated. THE LAW 1.      The applicant complains that he has not been granted a permit to install a water closet on his property.  He invokes Article 6 paras. 1 and 2 (Art. 6-1, 6-2) of the Convention.  Article 6 para. 1 (Art. 6-1) first sentence reads: ""In the determination of his civil rights and obligations or of any criminal charge against him, everyone is entitled to a fair and public hearing within a reasonable time by an independent and impartial tribunal established by law."" In an earlier decision the Commission has found that Article 6 para. 1 (Art. 6-1) of the Convention is not applicable to a determination as to whether an individual should be granted a permit to install a water closet on his property, since such a decision does not relate to that individual's ""civil rights"" (see No. 11225/85, Dec. 7.10.85, unpublished). The Commission finds no reason to depart from this view in the present case. It follows that this part of the application is incompatible ratione materiae with the provisions of the Convention within the meaning of Article 27 para. 2 (Art. 6-2). 2.      Article 6 para. 2 (Art. 6-2) of the Convention guarantees to an individual who is charged with a criminal offence the right to be presumed innocent until proven guilty.  However, the Commission finds no appearance of a violation of this provision on the facts presented by the applicant. It follows that in this respect the application is manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 27 para. 2 (Art. 27-2) of the Convention. 3.      The Commission further finds that there is no other provision in the Convention or its Protocols on which the applicant could claim a right to be allowed to install a water closet on his property. For these reasons, the Commission DECLARES THE APPLICATION INADMISSIBLE Deputy Secretary to the Commission      President of the Commission (J. RAYMOND)                       (C. A.

AUSTRIA (ARTICLE 50) (Application no. 9616/81 ) JUDGMENT STRASBOURG 29 September 1987 In the case of Erkne r and Hofauer [*] , The European Court of Human Rights, sitting, in accordance with Article 43 (art. 43) of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (""the Convention"") and the relevant provisions of the Rules of Court, as a Chamber composed of the following judges: Mr. R. Ryssdal , President , Mr. G. Lagergren , Mr. F. Gölcüklü , Mr. F. Matscher , Mr. B. Walsh , Sir Vincent Evans , Mr. C. Russo , and also of Mr. M.-A. Eissen , Registrar , and Mr. H. Petzold , Deputy Registrar , Having deliberated in private on 22 September 1987 , Delivers the following judgment, which was adopted on that date: PROCEDURE AND FACTS 1. The case was referred to the Court by the European Commission of Human Rights (""the Commission"") on 14 May 1986 . It originated in an application (no. 9616/81) against the Republic of Austria lodged with the Commission under Article 25 (art. 25) by a number of Austrian nationals - Mr. Johann Erkner , Mrs. Theresia Erkner and, after Mr. Erkner ’ s death, Mr. Josef Hofauer and Mrs. Theresia Hofauer - in 1979 and 1984. 2. In its judgment of 23 April 1987, the Court held that there had been a violation of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (art. 6-1, P1-1) in that the length of consolidation proceedings affecting land belonging to the applicants had exceeded a ""reasonable time"" and infringed the applicants ’ right of property (Series A no. 117, pp. 61-67, paragraphs 64-80 of the reasons and points 1 and 3 of the operative provisions). The only outstanding matter to be settled is the question of the application of Article 50 (art. 50) in the case. Accordingly, as regards the facts, reference should be made to paragraphs 8-57 of the aforementioned judgment (ibid., pp. 44-59). 3. The applicants claimed compensation in the sum of 760,000 Austrian schillings (ATS) for pecuniary damage and reimbursement of lawyers ’ fees, which they put at 582,099.10 ATS. The Austrian Government (""the Government"") and the Commission did not express a view on the matter. As the question of the application of Article 50 (art. 50) was therefore not ready for decision, the Court, in its judgment of 23 April 1987 , reserved it and invited the Government to submit their written comments within the next two months and, in particular, to notify the Court of any agreement reached between themselves and the applicants. 4. The Government ’ s memorial was received at the registry on 13 May 1987 and the applicants ’ reply on 5 June. 5. On 7 July, the applicants filed an offer of friendly settlement which the Government had made to them on 23 June. It read as follows: ""... With reference to the settlement talks held at the Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs on 13 May 1987 and 15 June 1987 in respect of the human-rights case of Erkner and Hofauer against the Republic of Austria, the Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs has the honour to suggest the following procedure for agreeing and implementing a settlement in just satisfaction pursuant to Article 50 (art. 50) of the Convention. 1. Having regard to the judgment of the European Court of Human Rights on 23 April 1987 in the case of Erkner and Hofauer (16/1986/114/162), the Republic of Austria states its willingness to pay the applicants a sum of 650,000 ATS (i.e. 350,000 ATS compensation and 300,000 ATS in costs). The applicants accept this sum in settlement of the expenses they incurred in taking legal action (costs of proceedings - domestic and other) and to cover all damage arising out of the proceedings up to and including 31 December 1986 . 2. The applicants will withdraw the application that they have made in this case to the Constitutional Court (B 255/86) as soon as the aforementioned sums have been paid into the account of their legal representative. 3. This sum shall be paid on trust ( zu treuen Handen ) to the applicants ’ legal representative, Dr. Erich Proksch , Post Office Giro account no. 154 5595, in two separate instalments: the Land of Upper Austria will pay 450,000 ATS and the Federation 200,000 ATS by 15 July 1987 at the latest. 4. A precondition of the payment of the sum due from the Federation to the applicants ’ legal representative is that the applicants shall produce a certificate to the effect that no tax demands by the Federation are outstanding against them. 5. Dr. Proksch undertakes to administer the said sums until the European Court of Human Rights has decided to strike the case in question out of the list of pending cases. 6. If the Court should decline to strike the case out, the sums would be repayable to the Federal Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry and to the Land of Upper Austria by Dr. Proksch . Dr. Proksch would in that case be given the relevant account numbers immediately. 7. The applicants declare that after performance of items 1-5 above, they will not assert, in respect of the period up to and including 31 December 1986, any claims against the Republic of Austria, either in an Austrian court or before an international or other authority, which in any way relate to the subject of application no. 9616/81 to the European Commission of Human Rights or case no. 16/1986/114/162 before the European Court of Human Rights. This letter and the reply in confirmation of it shall constitute an agreement within the meaning of Rule 53 § 4 of the Rules of Court of the European Court of Human Rights. For the Federal Minister Signed: Dr. Strohal "" The applicants ’ lawyer had replied on 29 June in the following terms: "" Thank you for your letter of 23 June 1987 concerning the above two cases of human-rights violations [ Erkner and Hofauer ; Poiss ]. I agree to the proposed settlement. I have asked my clients in both cases to produce certificates from the Tax Office to the effect that no tax debts are outstanding. Should the Republic of Austria not issue these certificates promptly, my clients must not thereby suffer any prejudice. I am accordingly expecting the time-limit to be complied with and that the amount of 1,350,000 ATS [650,000 ATS in the Erkner and Hofauer case; 700,000 ATS in the Poiss case] will be paid into my Post Office Giro account by 15 July 1987 at the latest. At the same time, I have informed the European Court of Human Rights of the agreed settlement and asked it to strike the cases out of its list as soon as I have let Strasbourg know that the amount of the settlement has in fact reached me by 15 July 1987 . ... Signed: Dr. E. Proksch "" The applicants therefore requested the Court to strike the case out of its list once it had satisfied itself of the equitable nature of the settlement thus agreed upon. 6. On 16 July, the Permanent Representative of Austria to the Council of Europe confirmed that his Government had agreed to pay the applicants the sum of 650,000 ATS and that this amount had been paid to them in the meantime. On behalf of his Government he accordingly likewise requested that the case should be struck out. 7. The Delegate of the Commission, when consulted, made it known on 12 August that he endorsed that course of action. On the same day, the applicants ’ lawyer informed the Registrar that he had indeed received the sum in question. AS TO THE LAW 8. Article 50 (art. 50) of the Convention provides as follows: ""If the Court finds that a decision or a measure taken by a legal authority or any other authority of a High Contracting Party is completely or partially in conflict with the obligations arising from the ... Convention, and if the internal law of the said Party allows only partial reparation to be made for the consequences of this decision or measure, the decision of the Court shall, if necessary, afford just satisfaction to the injured party."" Since its judgment of 23 April 1987 on the main issues in this case, the Court has been notified of a friendly settlement reached between the Government and the applicants in respect of the latter ’ s claims under Article 50 (art. 50). Having regard to the nature of the terms agreed and to the consent of the Commission ’ s Delegate, the Court finds that the settlement reached is ""equitable"" within the meaning of Rule 53 § 4 of the Rules of Court. Accordingly, the Court takes formal note of the settlement and concludes that it would be appropriate to strike the case out of its list pursuant to that Rule. FOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT UNANIMOUSLY Decides to strike the case out of its list. Done in English and in French, and notified in writing under Rule 54 § 2, second sub-paragraph, of the Rules of Court on 29 September 1987 .

On behalf of his Government he accordingly likewise requested that the case should be struck out. 7.   The Delegate of the Commission, when consulted, made it known on 12 August that he endorsed that course of action. On the same day, the applicants’ lawyer informed the Registrar that he had indeed received the sum in question. AS TO THE LAW 8.   Article 50 (art. 50) of the Convention provides as follows: ""If the Court finds that a decision or a measure taken by a legal authority or any other authority of a High Contracting Party is completely or partially in conflict with the obligations arising from the ... Convention, and if the internal law of the said Party allows only partial reparation to be made for the consequences of this decision or measure, the decision of the Court shall, if necessary, afford just satisfaction to the injured party."" Since its judgment of 23 April 1987 on the main issues in this case, the Court has been notified of a friendly settlement reached between the Government and the applicants in respect of the latter’s claims under Article 50 (art. 50). Having regard to the nature of the terms agreed and to the consent of the Commission’s Delegate, the Court finds that the settlement reached is ""equitable"" within the meaning of Rule 53 § 4 of the Rules of Court. Accordingly, the Court takes formal note of the settlement and concludes that it would be appropriate to strike the case out of its list pursuant to that Rule. FOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT UNANIMOUSLY Decides to strike the case out of its list.

BELGIUM (ARTICLE 50) (Application no. 9186/80) JUDGMENT STRASBOURG 14 September 1987 In the De Cubber case [*] , The European Court of Human Rights, sitting, in accordance with Article 43 (art. 43) of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (""the Convention"") and the relevant provisions of the Rules of Court, as a Chamber composed of the following judges: Mr. G. Wiarda , President , Mr. W. Ganshof van der Meersch , Mrs. D. Bindschedler-Robert , Mr. F. Gölcüklü , Mr. F. Matscher , Sir Vincent Evans , Mr. R. Bernhardt , and also of Mr. M.-A. Eissen , Registrar , and Mr. H. Petzold , Deputy Registrar , Having deliberated in private on 22 May and 24 August 1987, Delivers the following judgment, which was adopted on the last-mentioned date: PROCEDURE 1.   The case was referred to the Court by the European Commission of Human Rights (""the Commission"") on 12 October 1983. It originated in an application (no. 9186/80) against the Kingdom of Belgium lodged with the Commission on 10 October 1980 by a Belgian citizen, Mr. Albert De Cubber. 2.   In a judgment of 26 October 1984, the Court held that there had been a violation of Article 6 § 1 (art. 6-1) of the Convention in that the case of the applicant - who had been sentenced by the Oudenaarde court on 29 June 1979 to several years’ imprisonment - had not been heard by an impartial tribunal (Series A no. 86, paragraphs 23-36 of the reasons and point 1 of the operative provisions, pp. 13-20). The only outstanding matter to be settled is the question of the application of Article 50 (art. 50) in the present case. As regards the facts, the Court will therefore confine itself here to giving the pertinent details; for further particulars, reference should be made to paragraphs 7 to 20 of the aforementioned judgment (ibid., pp. 8-12). 3.   In a note filed on 16 April 1984, Mr. De Cubber had claimed just satisfaction for pecuniary and non-pecuniary damage. As the Government had not taken a stand on this question, the Court, in its judgment of 26 October 1984, reserved it and invited the Government to submit their written comments within the next two months and, in particular, to notify the Court of any agreement reached between them and the applicant (paragraph 37 of the reasons and point 2 of the operative provisions). 4.   The President granted an extension of this time-limit on 13 December 1984 and again on 12 March 1985. 5.   Acting on the Court’s instructions, the Registrar wrote to the Agent of the Government on 29 October 1984. His letter, which made reference to the wording of and the case-law on Article 50 (art. 50), enquired - ""without prejudice to the decision which the Court might take on the point in question"" - whether the Belgian authorities considered that Belgian law provided ""any means whereby full reparation can be made for the consequences of the breach found in the present case"" (see, mutatis mutandis, the Piersack judgment of 26 October 1984, Series A no. 85, p. 13, § 5). On 3 April 1985, the Agent replied that the Minister of Justice had just requested the procureur général (State prosecutor) attached to the Court of Cassation to challenge before the latter Court the Ghent Court of Appeal’s judgment of 4 February 1980, which had confirmed the main points in the Oudenaarde court’s decision (Series A no. 86, p. 9, § 13). The Minister had taken this step pursuant to Article 441 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, which provides as follows: ""Where, on production of formal instructions which he has received from the ... Minister of Justice, the procureur général attached to the Court of Cassation impugns before the Chamber hearing appeals on points of law in criminal cases, involving serious, lesser and petty offences (en matière criminelle, correctionnelle et de police), judicial acts or judgments as being contrary to the law, such acts or judgments may be annulled ...."" 6.   Subsequently - from May 1985 to February 1987 -, the Registrar was in touch with the Agent of the Government and the applicant’s lawyer on numerous occasions with a view to having the applicant’s claims examined - and, if appropriate, settled - without awaiting the outcome of the proceedings pending before the Court of Cassation. 7.   On 20 February 1987, the Agent of the Government indicated that the Court of Cassation had given judgment on 27 January. The representative of the procureur général had summarised his final submissions in the following terms: ""The Belgian State is under an obligation to make such reparation as is possible under domestic law for the consequences of the violation found by the European Court in its judgment of 26 October 1984 and to recognise that judgment as being final and binding. Recourse to the procedure laid down by Article 441 of the Code of Criminal Procedure enables this result to be achieved. There is no impediment in the fact that in 1980 your Court in large measure dismissed an appeal by De Cubber on points of law where the underlying facts were identical to those underlying the present challenge, since the Belgian State’s obligations under the European Court’s judgment constitute matters of law of which your Court was unable to take cognisance when it ruled on De Cubber’s appeal in 1980. To sum up, those obligations warrant a finding that the present challenge is both admissible and well-founded."" The Court of Cassation declared the State prosecutor’s application inadmissible, for the following reasons: ""... Whereas the Court of Cassation, a judicial body, is not to be identified with one of the Contracting Parties mentioned in Article 50 (art. 50) of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, in the present case the Belgian State; Whereas, in the event of dismissal of an accused’s appeal on points of law against a decision determining a criminal charge against him, a challenge to that dismissal, submitted, on the instructions of the Minister of Justice, in accordance with Article 441 of the Code of Criminal Procedure and grounded on an illegality alleged to be prejudicial to the convicted person, is admissible only if that illegality arises from facts disclosed or discovered after dismissal of the appeal and those facts are brought to light by material that was not before the Court of Cassation in its earlier proceedings, so that it could not take cognisance of them at that time; Whereas the existence of a fact of this kind is not revealed by the judgment delivered on 26 October 1984 by the European Court of Human Rights, which judgment deals solely with a question of law on which the Court of Cassation ruled in its judgment of 15 April 1980; ..."" 8.   The applicant supplied further particulars of his claims for just satisfaction in a memorial filed at the registry by his lawyer on 24 March 1987. The Government replied thereto on 30 April. On 21 May, the Secretary to the Commission communicated its Delegate’s observations to the Registrar. 9.   On 11 May, Mr. De Cubber presented new claims for compensation, which he had drafted himself. These claims, and also the comments on his lawyer’s memorial and on the Delegate’s observations that he submitted on 5 August, were transmitted to his lawyer by the Registrar. 10.   On 22 May, the Court decided that, in the particular circumstances, there was no need to hold oral hearings. AS TO THE LAW 11.   Under Article 50 (art. 50) of the Convention, ""If the Court finds that a decision or a measure taken by a legal authority or any other authority of a High Contracting Party is completely or partially in conflict with the obligations arising from the ... Convention, and if the internal law of the said Party allows only partial reparation to be made for the consequences of this decision or measure, the decision of the Court shall, if necessary, afford just satisfaction to the injured party."" The applicant’s claims under this provision were for compensation for damage as well as reimbursement of costs and expenses. He also sought a declaration to the effect that the sums awarded were to be free from attachment. I.   DAMAGE A. Claims of the applicant 12.   In his observations Mr. De Cubber began by observing, ""for the record more than anything"", that, including the duration of his detention on remand, he had spent four years and fifty-three days (from 4 April 1977 to 27 May 1981) in prison for the offences giving rise to the proceedings which led to the Ghent Court of Appeal’s judgment of 4 February 1980. He considered that he would not have been in custody for so long if the violation found by the European Court had not occurred. 13.   Whilst acknowledging that the quashing of the aforesaid judgment would probably not have prevented the institution of fresh criminal proceedings, the applicant further maintained that a prosecution in respect of the acts committed before he was taken into custody would have been time-barred. He accordingly concluded that ""the detention undergone following that judgment, or the detention on remand warranted by that decision"" had to be regarded as ""invalid"" and, as his ""principal plea"", claimed compensation for the 1,514 days during which he was detained. 14.   Mr. De Cubber also drew attention to a fresh sentence, of five years’ imprisonment, which he had received on 26 June 1986. This sentence, which had been confirmed by the Brussels Court of Appeal on 6 March 1987, had been based on the fact that he was classified in law as a recidivist, an aggravating circumstance without which the court would have been able to impose at most a sentence only half as long. Whilst accepting that it was difficult to make a ""prognosis"", he claimed that the new sentence should probably not have exceeded eighteen months. In short, there was a period of forty-two months, or 1,260 days, which he considered ""invalid"". 15.   Taking his age, state of health and family situation into account, Mr. De Cubber evaluated the pecuniary and non-pecuniary damage resulting from unjustified detention at 2,000 BF per day, giving a total of 5,548,OOO BF for 2,774 days. 16.   Finally, the applicant asserted that a ""conditional sentence"" of imprisonment imposed by the judgment of 4 February 1980 should be deemed ""null and void"", failing which the damage sustained would be even greater. B. Observations of the Government and of the Commission 17.   The Government submitted that the allegation of pecuniary and non-pecuniary loss in the sum of 5,548,000 BF by reason of imprisonment for four years and fifty-three days was ""totally misconceived"". 18.   As regards pecuniary damage, the Government’s arguments may be summarised as follows: - The Ghent Court of Appeal had itself recalled that the applicant was already a recidivist and there was nothing to suggest that the sentence would have been less severe if the violation found had not occurred. - In no circumstances would the quashing of the judgment of 4 February 1980 have led to the applicant’s acquittal. - As regards the applicant’s fresh sentence, it was true that the Brussels Court of Appeal had indeed noted that he was classified in law as a recidivist; however, although it was legally entitled to rely on this as a ground for imposing a penalty in excess of the maximum laid down for cases where recidivism is not taken into account, it had not done so. The applicant therefore could not claim that had he not been so classified the sentence would have been only half as long as that passed on 6 March 1987. - In short, Mr. De Cubber’s position had in no way been affected by the breach of Article 6 (art. 6) and his allegation of pecuniary damage was ""totally unwarranted and unfounded"". 19.   As to non-pecuniary damage, the Government took the view that the European Court’s judgment had already provided the applicant with ""moral satisfaction"". They declared, however, that they were willing to pay a sum of 75,000 BF under this head, ""having regard to the fact that Mr. De Cubber had legitimate grounds for questioning the impartiality of the Oudenaarde court"". 20.   In the view of the Commission’s Delegate, since the Ghent Court of Appeal’s judgment had not been quashed, there was no possibility in the present case of reaching a result coming close to restitutio in integrum. Yet one could not speculate as to what the outcome of the proceedings in question would have been had there been no violation of the Convention. In the Delegate’s opinion, Mr. De Cubber had not established that he had sustained pecuniary damage as a result of the breach of Article 6 (art. 6); on the other hand, he had suffered non-pecuniary loss for which sufficient satisfaction was not provided by the European Court’s judgment of 26 October 1984. The Delegate was therefore in favour of awarding more than the Government proposed, but he did not suggest a figure. C. Decision of the Court 21.   The Court notes firstly that the conditions for the application of Article 50 (art. 50) are satisfied: the proceedings in Belgium after 26 October 1984 (see paragraph 7 above) have not redressed the violation found in its judgment of that date; they have not brought about a result as close to restitutio in integrum as was possible in the nature of things (see, a contrario, the Piersack judgment of 26 October 1984, Series A no. 85, pp. 15-16, § 11). On 27 January 1987, the Court of Cassation declared inadmissible the application which the procureur général attached to that Court had submitted to it on the instructions of the Minister of Justice; it did not quash the Ghent Court of Appeal’s judgment of 4 February 1980, with the result that the applicant’s case was not referred back to another court for retrial (see paragraphs 5 and 7 above). The European Court therefore has to determine, in the context of Article 50 (art. 50), the consequences which its judgment of 26 October 1984 entails for the Belgian State, the latter being responsible for the functioning of the totality of its institutions (see, amongst other authorities, mutatis mutandis, the Foti and Others judgment of 10 December 1982, Series A no. 56, p. 21, § 63, the Zimmermann and Steiner judgment of 13 July 1983, Series A no. 66, p. 13, § 32, and the Lingens judgment of 8 July 1986, Series A no. 103, p. 28, § 46). 22.   It follows from the Strasbourg judgment that in the present case an award of just satisfaction can only be based on the fact that ""the impartiality of the Oudenaarde court was capable of appearing to the applicant to be open to doubt"" (Series A no. 86, p.16, § 30). That judgment pointed out that whilst the European Court itself had no reason to doubt the investigating judge’s impartiality, his presence on the bench during the trial at first instance provided grounds for ""some legitimate misgivings"" on Mr. De Cubber’s part (ibid., p. 16, § 30). By way of clarification, the Court made two further observations: firstly, the defect ""involved matters of internal organisation"" since its source was the very composition of the trial court; secondly, ""the Court of Appeal [had not cured] that defect since it [had not quashed] on that ground the judgment of 29 June 1979 in its entirety"" (ibid., p. 19, § 33). 23.   The Court cannot speculate as to what the outcome of the proceedings in question would have been had the violation of the Convention not occurred; there is nothing to show that the result would probably have been more favourable to the applicant. The arguments he adduced on this point are not convincing. On the dates when the Oudenaarde court and the Ghent Court of Appeal gave their decisions the question of a time-bar to prosecution did not arise. Besides, it is not established that if the Court of Cassation had quashed the Ghent judgment, such a bar would have applied to the acts Mr. De Cubber committed before he was taken into detention and would have ""invalidated"" that detention. Again, the ""conditional sentence"", the validity of which Mr. De Cubber contested (see paragraph 16 above), was not in fact implemented. In any case, it was actually an alternative sanction, consisting of three months’ imprisonment, to be undergone in the event of his not paying the fine of 20,000 BF imposed by the Ghent Court of Appeal on 4 February 1980. Finally, the proceedings that led to the imposition on 26 June 1986 of a fresh sentence, which was confirmed by the Brussels Court of Appeal on 6 March 1987 (see paragraph 14 above), cannot be regarded as relevant, since the Oudenaarde court itself had already taken note, on 29 June 1979, of the fact that the accused was a recidivist (Series A no. 86, p. 9, § 12). In short, no causal link between the violation of the Convention and the length of the detention has been established. 24.   On the other hand, the presence on the trial-court bench of the person who had previously acted as investigating judge provided grounds for some legitimate misgivings on Mr. De Cubber’s part (see the judgment of 26 October 1984, Series A no. 86, p. 16, § 30). In this respect, he sustained non-pecuniary damage which is not fully compensated for by the Strasbourg judgment. Taking its decision on an equitable basis, as required by Article 50 (art. 50) (see, amongst other authorities, mutatis mutandis, the Colozza judgment of 12 February 1985, Series A no. 89, p. 17, § 38), the Court awards the applicant compensation of 100,000 BF under this head. II.   COSTS AND EXPENSES A. Introduction 25.   The applicant sought reimbursement of court costs and of lawyer’s fees and disbursements. According to the Court’s established case-law, to be entitled to an award of costs and expenses under Article 50 (art. 50) the injured party must have incurred them in order to seek, through the domestic legal system, prevention or rectification of a violation, to have the same established by the Commission and later by the Court or to obtain redress therefor (see, as the most recent authority, the Feldbrugge judgment of 27 July 1987, Series A no. 124, § 14). Furthermore, it has to be shown that the costs and expenses were actually incurred, were necessarily incurred and were reasonable as to quantum (ibid.). B. Costs incurred in Belgium 26.   Mr. De Cubber claimed two amounts in respect of costs incurred in Belgium. The first - 39,742 BF - represented the costs awarded against him by the Oudenaarde court on 29 June 1979 (30,784 BF) and by the Ghent Court of Appeal on 4 February 1980 (8,958 BF). The second - 8,221 BF - corresponded to the costs he had been ordered to pay by the Court of Cassation on 15 April 1980. 27.   The Government did not submit any observations on this point. 28.   The Commission’s Delegate referred to the criteria applied by the Court in the Piersack case and expressed the view that this claim was reasonable. 29.   Reimbursement of the court costs relating to the proceedings before the Oudenaarde court and the Ghent Court of Appeal on the merits of the case cannot, in the Court’s opinion, be ordered, there being no sufficient connection between those costs and the violation it found. On the other hand, the applicant is entitled to be paid the costs referable to the proceedings which he himself instituted before the Court of Cassation, since in one of the grounds of his appeal he sought ""rectification"" of the violation of Article 6 (art. 6) ""through the domestic legal system"" (see the above-mentioned Feldbrugge judgment, § 14). The amount involved is 8,221 BF. C. Costs incurred in Strasbourg 30.   In connection with the proceedings before the Convention institutions, the applicant claimed 150,000 BF for lawyer’s fees and 20,000 BF for sundry expenses. In addition, he estimated at 50,000 BF the costs he would have to bear if the Court held a hearing on the application of Article 50 (art. 50). 31.   For the Government, the figure of 100,000 BF put forward by the applicant on 24 September 1986 was acceptable. However, they considered the figure of 220,000 BF that was finally claimed (in the memorial of 24 March 1987; see paragraph 8 above) to be unwarranted and exaggerated; they pointed out in this connection that the item of 50,000 BF was hypothetical. 32.   The Commission’s Delegate relied on the criteria applied by the Court in the Piersack case and expressed the opinion that Mr. De Cubber’s claim was reasonable. 33.   The Court sees no reason to doubt that the applicant actually incurred the expenses in question, save those which he anticipated for his lawyer’s attendance at a hearing on Article 50 (art. 50) but which did not arise as no such hearing was held (see paragraph 10 above). As to whether the expenses were necessarily incurred and were reasonable as to quantum, the Court notes that Mr. De Cubber did not apply for legal aid before the Convention institutions and that the costs and fees enumerated are not abnormally high. The sum of 170,000 BF should therefore be reimbursed to the applicant. III.  REQUEST THAT THE SUMS AWARDED BE DECLARED FREE FROM ATTACHMENT 34.   The applicant requested the Court to declare in its judgment that the sums awarded under Article 50 (art. 50) were to be free from attachment. He provided no information as to the probability of such a measure. 35.   As it has been formulated, this issue is therefore hypothetical and abstract. Accordingly, it is not an issue which can be determined by the Court, especially as neither the Agent of the Government nor the Delegate of the Commission submitted any observations on it. FOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT UNANIMOUSLY 1. Holds that the Kingdom of Belgium is to pay to the applicant 100,000 (one hundred thousand) Belgian francs for damage and to reimburse to him 178,221 (one hundred and seventy-eight thousand two hundred and twenty-one) Belgian francs in respect of costs and expenses; 2. Rejects the remainder of the claim for just satisfaction; 3. Holds that there is no call to rule on the request that the sums awarded to the applicant be declared free from attachment.

Wiarda , President , Mr. R. Ryssdal , Mr. J. Cremona , Mr. W. Ganshof van der Meersch , Mr. F. Gölcüklü , Sir Vincent Evans , Mr. C. Russo , and also of Mr. M.-A. Eissen , Registrar , and Mr. H. Petzold , Deputy Registrar , Having deliberated in private on 22 May and on 24 and 25 August 1987, Delivers the following judgment, which was adopted on the last-mentioned date: PROCEDURE AND FACTS 1.   The case was referred to the Court by the European Commission of Human Rights (""the Commission"") on 19 December 1984. The case originated in an application (no. 9063/80) against the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland lodged with the Commission in 1980 by Mr. Joseph and Mrs. Yvonne Gillow, British citizens. 2.   By judgment of 24 November 1986, the Court held, inter alia, that there had been a breach of Article 8 (art. 8) of the Convention by reason of the way in which the Guernsey Housing Laws were applied in the applicants’ case (Series A no. 109, paragraphs 57-58 of the reasons and point 2 of the operative provisions, pp. 23-24 and 29). The only outstanding matter to be settled is the question of the application of Article 50 (art. 50) in the present case. Accordingly, as regards the facts, reference should be made to paragraphs 9-37 of the above-mentioned judgment (ibid., pp. 8-17). 3.   The applicants had reserved their position on the application of Article 50 (art. 50) until after having knowledge of the Court’s judgment on the merits. In these conditions, neither the Government of the United Kingdom (""the Government"") nor the Commission were able to take any stand on the issue. In its judgment of 24 November 1986, the Court accordingly reserved the question, and invited the applicants, duly represented by a lawyer in accordance with Rule 30 of the Rules of Court, to file within the forthcoming three months any claim for just satisfaction that they might have (ibid., paragraph 76 of the reasons and point 6 of the operative provisions, p. 29). 4.   Having duly appointed a lawyer, Mr. and Mrs. Gillow, in a memorial of 17 February 1987, claimed just satisfaction in respect of material and moral damage, as well as costs and expenses. In accordance with the President’s directions, the Government filed a memorial on 24 April. On 19 May, the Secretary to the Commission informed the Registrar that its Delegate did not intend to submit any observations. 5.   On 22 May 1987, the Chamber decided that, in the particular circumstances, there was no need to hold oral hearings and directed the Registrar to ask the applicants for particulars of the costs and expenses claimed. This information was received on 20 July and 3 August 1987. The Government and the Commission commented thereon on 5 and 21 August 1987, respectively. 6.   On 30 June, Mrs. Gillow informed the Court that her husband had died on 8 June 1987. 7.   Subsequently, Mr. Cremona, Mr. Ganshof van der Meersch, Mr. Gölcüklü and Mr. Russo, substitute judges, replaced Mr. Thór Vilhjálmsson, Mr. Lagergren, Mr. Pettiti and Mr. Macdonald, who were prevented from taking part in the final deliberation on 24 and 25 August 1987 (Rules 22 § 1 and 24 § 1). AS TO THE LAW 8.   Under Article 50 (art. 50) of the Convention, ""If the Court finds that a decision or a measure taken by a legal authority or any other authority of a High Contracting Party is completely or partially in conflict with the obligations arising from the ... Convention, and if the internal law of the said Party allows only partial reparation to be made for the consequences of this decision or measure, the decision of the Court shall, if necessary, afford just satisfaction to the injured party."" 9.   Mr. and Mrs. Gillow claimed just satisfaction in respect of both pecuniary and moral damage and costs and expenses. In addition, throughout the proceedings before the Court, they sought an order directing the Government to restore their ""residence qualifications"" in respect of Guernsey. The Court is not, however, empowered under the Convention to make an order of this kind (see, mutatis mutandis, the McGoff judgment of 26 October 1984, Series A no. 83, p. 28, § 31). I.   PECUNIARY DAMAGE 10.   Mr. and Mrs. Gillow alleged that, as a result of the refusals of permanent and temporary licences (see the above-mentioned Gillow judgment, Series A no. 109, pp. 9-11, §§ 15, 16 and 20), they had been obliged to sell their home ""Whiteknights"" and, on account of their inferior bargaining position at the time, to accept a price less than the true market value. They further contended that the compensation payable to them should include a sum equal to the difference between the proceeds of sale of ""Whiteknights"" and what they would have to pay for a replacement property in Guernsey. Under these heads, they claimed a total sum of £50,000. They also sought reimbursement of estate agents’ fees on the sale of ""Whiteknights"" and fees for a house survey, totalling £735. The Government contested these claims. In their view, the sale in question had not been necessitated by the refusal of licences and, in any event, had been premature in that it was effected prior to the determination of Mrs. Gillow’s appeal to the Royal Court (ibid., p. 12, §§ 24-25). Furthermore, the claims in respect of loss on the sale and the costs of a replacement property were imprecise and unsubstantiated by evidence. 11.   It is true that the refusal of licences did not oblige the applicants to sell ""Whiteknights"", for there was nothing to prevent them from letting the property. However, since they were refused a licence to occupy the house themselves, the Court does not consider that they acted unreasonably in deciding to dispose of it. It is therefore appropriate that the above-mentioned fees of £735 should be reimbursed. As regards the alleged loss on the sale, the Court notes that the applicants obtained a price which fell within the range of the initial valuation made by the estate agents (see paragraph 150 of the Commission’s report). It is not established that the price was less than the market value at the time. This claim cannot therefore be accepted. The claim relating to the costs of a replacement property is likewise unsubstantiated by evidence. 12.   The applicants maintained that had they been permitted to continue to live in Guernsey, they would have been able to work there for a further four years, each at a salary of £8,000 a year - Mr. Gillow as a horticultural consultant and Mrs. Gillow as a teacher. They accordingly sought £64,000 for loss of earnings. The Court agrees with the Government that this claim must be rejected, since there is no evidence establishing that the applicants would have been able to find employment in these capacities in Guernsey at the time. II.   MORAL DAMAGE 13.   The applicants claimed £100,000 for ""moral damage"". In their submission, they had since 1978 sustained substantial prejudice as a result of the Housing Authority’s decisions; during this long period, their inability to lead a settled existence had dominated their lives; and the denial of their right to respect for their home and the subsequent prolonged hardship occasioned by the repeated refusals of temporary licences had caused them severe stress and anxiety. The Government contended that, in the circumstances of the case, the Court’s finding of violation of the Convention constituted in itself sufficient just satisfaction under this head. In the alternative, they argued that the sum claimed was disproportionate and suggested a figure of £1,000. 14.   In the Court’s view, Mr. and Mrs. Gillow undoubtedly sustained significant moral damage which cannot be compensated solely by the finding of a violation. For one year, they lived with a feeling of insecurity, prompted by uncertainty as to whether they would finally be permitted to stay in their home or be expelled from it. Furthermore, their prosecution for unlawful occupation of their home added to their already precarious situation (see the above-mentioned Gillow judgment, Series A no. 109, p. 23, § 57). In the outcome, they felt obliged to dispose of their home in Guernsey and must have experienced considerable stress and anxiety in consequence of that and in settling elsewhere. 15.   Taking all the relevant factors into account and making an assessment on an equitable basis, as is required by Article 50 (art. 50), the Court awards the sum of £10,000 under this head. III.  COSTS AND EXPENSES 16.   The applicants sought reimbursement of various items of expenditure which they said they had incurred. The Government pointed out that no vouchers had been supplied in respect of these items and contended that certain of them were either not necessary or not reasonable in amount. 17.   The Court has examined the claims under this head in the light of the criteria which emerge from its established case-law (see, amongst other authorities, the Zimmermann and Steiner judgment of 13 July 1983, Series A no. 66, p. 14, § 36). (a) Miscellaneous expenses 18.   The applicants claimed £634 for legal and court costs incurred in Guernsey and for other sundry expenses. These items were not contested by the Government. The Court allows this sum, which it finds reasonable. (b) Travel and subsistence expenses 19.   The applicants sought reimbursement of travel and subsistence expenses relating to: (i)  five visits by them to Strasbourg for consultations with the Secretariat of the Commission and the registry of the Court (£1,950); (ii)  their attendance at the Commission’s hearing on 9 December 1982 (£600); (iii) their attendance at the delivery of the Court’s judgment of 24 November 1986 (£600); (iv)  Mr. Dun’s services in connection with the Court’s hearing on 18 February 1986 (£1,300). The applicants made no claim in respect of their attendance at the last-mentioned hearing, their expenses on this occasion having being paid by the Council of Europe. 20.   No vouchers have been supplied in respect of item (i), but the Court is in any event unable to accept it. The matters discussed in the consultations could have been dealt with by correspondence, with the result that this expenditure cannot be regarded as necessarily incurred. The same applies to item (iv). Mr. Dun attended the Court’s hearing of his own free will and the Court had not been informed in advance of his presence. He acted neither as the representative of the applicants nor as a person approved by the President of the Chamber to assist them (Rule 30 of the Rules of Court). 21.   On the other hand, the Court considers that items (ii) and (iii) can be regarded as necessarily incurred. The applicants presented their own case before the Commission and thus obviously had to be present at its hearing. The Court also finds that it was justified for them to attend at the delivery of its 1986 judgment; unlike the applicants in the Sunday Times case, on which the Government relied on this point (see the judgment of 6 November 1980, Series A no. 38, p. 16, § 35), Mr. and Mrs. Gillow were still not, at this stage, represented by a lawyer. The amounts claimed for items (ii) and (iii) appear to the Court to be reasonable, and it therefore allows them both. (c) Costs relating to the Article 50 (art. 50) proceedings 22.   Finally, the applicants claimed £1,000 in respect of the fees of Mr. Bencini, the lawyer who represented them in the Article 50 (art. 50) proceedings. Fees for this purpose were incurred in compliance with the Court’s own direction (see the above-mentioned Gillow judgment, Series A no. 109, point 6 (b) of the operative provisions, p. 29). As to quantum, the Court, in view of the limited role played by this lawyer at this final stage of the proceedings, considers £300 (three hundred pounds sterling) to be reasonable. IV.   PAYMENT OF THE AMOUNTS AWARDED 23.   Since this case relates to events and their consequences which were experienced by Mr. and Mrs. Gillow together, the Court considers it equitable that all the sums awarded in this judgment should be paid to the survivor of them, Mrs. Gillow. FOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT UNANIMOUSLY 1. Holds that the United Kingdom is to pay to Mrs. Gillow £10,735 (ten thousand seven hundred and thirty-five pounds) for damage and £2,134 (two thousand one hundred and thirty-four pounds) for costs and expenses; 2. Rejects the remainder of the claim for just satisfaction. Done in English and in French, and notified in writing on 14 September 1987 pursuant to Rule 54 § 2, second sub-paragraph, of the Rules of Court.

NØRGAARD, President S. TRECHSEL E. BUSUTTIL G. JÖRUNDSSON A.S. GÖZÜBÜYÜK A. WEITZEL J.C. SOYER H.G. SCHERMERS H. DANELIUS G. BATLINER H. VANDENBERGHE Mrs.  G.H. THUNE Sir  Basil HALL MM.  F. MARTINEZ C.L. ROZAKIS Mrs.  J. LIDDY Mr.  H.C. KRÜGER, Secretary to the Commission Having regard to Article 25 (Art. 25) of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms; Having regard to the application introduced on 25 February 1988 by C. against the United Kingdom and registered on 22 March 1988 under file No. 13718/88; Having regard to the report provided for in Rule 40 of the Rules of Procedure of the Commission; Having deliberated; Decides as follows: THE FACTS The applicant is a citizen of Tanzania, born in 1957 and resident in B., England.  He is a grocer / off-licence proprietor by profession.  He is represented before the Commission by Messrs.  Thakrar & Co., Solicitors, Southall. The facts of the case as submitted by the applicant, and which may be deduced from the documents submitted in support of the application, may be summarised as follows: The applicant arrived in the United Kingdom on 23 October 1976 to settle there with his parents.  His father is a British Protected Person and his mother an Indian national.  The family left Tanzania allegedly under some persecution as East African Asians, the father being unable, as a British Protected Person, to obtain an extension of his trading permit from the Tanzanian authorities.  The applicant and his family were given indefinite leave of entry. The applicant lives with and partially supports his parents. His mother works away from home during the week and his father lives with his son all the time as he is in poor health.  He provides limited assistance to the applicant in his work.  The applicant is the joint-owner of a grocery / off-licence business with his mother and has paid the mortgage on his house.  He has some savings with which the family hope to move to another town after selling the business. On 1 September 1979 the applicant married an Indian citizen who had been allowed to enter the United Kingdom as his fiancée.  On 14 August 1980 a daughter was born to the couple.  The daughter has British nationality by virtue of her birth on United Kingdom territory.  The applicant's wife was granted indefinite leave of entry on 29 July 1982.  The couple became estranged and apparently separated in February 1983. On returning from a visit to India on 20 November 1982 the applicant, accompanied by another woman, was arrested by HM customs at London Heathrow Airport for being in possession of approximately 10 kilos of cannabis resin which had an estimated value of £20,000.  They were both prosecuted. On 21 March 1984 the applicant was convicted for illegal importation of cannabis and sentenced to 30 months' imprisonment.  He submits that his role in the offence was only that of courier, that the drug was not a dangerous one like heroin, that there is no danger of him re-offending, that he himself is not a drug user and that he has no other criminal convictions. During his imprisonment the applicant was well-behaved and became reconciled with his wife.  The whole family now live together and a second child, a son, was born on 30 November 1986. On 6 February 1985 the Home Secretary made a deportation order against the applicant under Section 3(5)(b) of the Immigration Act 1971, the applicant's deportation back to Tanzania being deemed ""conducive to the public good"". The Home Office explanatory statement (dated 9 May 1985) to the Immigration Appeal Tribunal stated as follows: ""The Secretary of State carefully considered the appellant's position in the United Kingdom.  The appellant had been convicted of being involved in the illegal importation of a large quantity of cannabis, with a street value of £20,000, and had been sentenced to 30 months' imprisonment.  The appellant was 27 years old and was of an age where he could be expected to make a life for himself in Tanzania.  He had spent the formative years of his life in Tanzania, coming to the United Kingdom in 1976 when he was nineteen years old. The appellant had been in employment prior to his conviction; and his parents were settled in the United Kingdom.  The appellant's marriage had not subsisted prior to his conviction and although the appellant claimed to have been reconciled with (his wife) he had also maintained contact with (his co-accused).  The appellant's wife was an Indian national who had spent the formative years of her life in India (where her parents still resided) and had only come to the United Kingdom in August 1979 at the age of 18; moreover her daughter was only four years old and was of an age where she could be expected to adapt to life in her father's country should the parents intend to live together in the future. There were no known compassionate factors in his favour other than these family ties to outweigh the gravity of his offence. Having regard to all the relevant factors, including those set out in paragraph 156 of HC 169 (Immigration Rules), the Secretary of State decided that in view of the appellant's conviction and the nature and amount of the drugs involved it would be conducive to the public good to deport the appellant."" The relevant part of paragraph 156 of the Statement in Changes in Immigration Rules HC 169 provides as follows: ""In considering whether to give effect to a recommendation for deportation made by a court on conviction the Secretary of State will take into account every relevant factor known to him, including: age, length of residence in the United Kingdom; strength of connections with the United Kingdom, personal history, including character, conduct and employment record; domestic circumstances; the nature of the offence of which the person was convicted; previous criminal record; compassionate circumstances; any representations received..."" Paragraph 159 of HC 169 deals generally with the Secretary of State's powers to deport for reasons conducive to the public good, even where, as in this case, there has been no court recommendation to deport.  It provides that the Secretary of State must take into account all the relevant circumstances of the case including those listed in the aforementioned paragraph 156. On 21 June 1985 the Immigration Appeal Tribunal dismissed the applicant's appeal against the deportation order for the following reasons: ""We have carefully considered the evidence and the manner in which (the Home Secretary's) discretion should be exercised, having particular regard to the matters set out in paragraph 156 (Immigration Rules).  In our view there are undoubtedly compassionate circumstances in this case, in that the appellant has strong family connections here by reason of his parents, his daughter and his wife with whom he is now said to be reconciled.  We also recognise that a return to Tanzania must be a highly unpleasant prospect for him to face, and that life will not be easy there.  Nevertheless the offence of which he was convicted involved a large amount of cannabis resin and was in our view of an extremely serious nature.  In our opinion the compassionate circumstances do not outweigh the consideration of public interest in this case, and this appeal is dismissed."" No reference is made in the Tribunal decision to the applicant's submissions under Article 8 (Art. 8) of the Convention which had been put before the Tribunal. The applicant sought judicial review of the Tribunal's decision on the grounds, inter alia, that there had been a failure to take into account Article 8 (Art. 8) of the Convention.  The application for leave to move for judicial review was refused by a single judge of the High Court on 4 October 1985.  On 29 January 1986 the Court of Appeal overturned that decision and granted leave.  Back before the High Court on 28 January 1987 Mr.  Justice Taylor held, after reviewing the relevant Convention case-law, including the case of Mmes Abdulaziz, Cabales and Balkandali v. the United Kingdom (Eur.  Court H.R., judgment of 28 May 1985, Series A No. 94), and the relevant domestic case-law on the effects of the Convention, that ""the extent to which the Convention is relevant or may be used is to assist in interpreting our statute law if there is ambiguity or doubt.  What it certainly cannot do is override or replace or provide a test under our legislation where our legislation is perfectly clear"".  He found no allegation in the applicant's case that Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1971 was ambiguous.  Moreover, he also found no evidence that the Immigration Appeal Tribunal, despite their silence on the point, did not anyway take into account the applicant's submissions under Article 8 (Art. 8) of the Convention as ""representations received on the person's behalf"" pursuant to paragraph 156 of the Statement in Changes in Immigration Rules HC 169. Mr.  Justice Taylor concluded his judgment as follows: ""Finally, I would say that on the factual background to this case, if one looks at the decision of the tribunal and its review of the evidence, there are certainly grounds upon which it would be perfectly reasonable to uphold the decision of the Secretary of State.  This was a case not of some minor drug offence, being in possession of a small amount of drugs or even being in possession of it with intent to supply.  This was a serious case of the importation of a large quantity of cannabis.  Clearly the object must have been commercial.  There is an interest of the highest importance in demonstrating not merely to the person concerned but more importantly to others who might be minded to act as couriers that an offence of that character may carry a very severe penalty indeed.  In this case it carried a penalty of 30 months' imprisonment, but it was considered by the Secretary of State that it was also one which justified deportation. Even if one looks at the criteria of the Article (Article 8 of the Convention) (Art. 8) itself, one can well see that the facts here could justify applying the exception that this was a deportation necessary for the prevention of crime and for the protection of health.  Certainly I would not be prepared to hold that a decision to that effect was one which no reasonable Secretary of State, or as the decision which is challenged here makes more relevant, one which no reasonable tribunal could have reached. For all those reasons this application must be dismissed."" An appeal against this latter decision to the Court of Appeal was dismissed on 30 October 1987 for broadly similar reasons, adding that the applicant could derive no legitimate expectation that in his kind of case the Secretary of State or the Immigration Appeal Tribunal would have regard to Article 8 (Art. 8) of the Convention.  One of the three Court of Appeal Judges, Glidewell LJ, also expressed the view that ""it cannot be implied from Section 5 of the Immigration Act 1971 or the relevant paragraphs of the Immigration Rules that the Convention is intended to be or is in any way a relevant consideration for the Secretary of State or the Immigration Appeal Tribunal in the circumstances of the applicant's case.  As the relevant law displayed no ambiguities the Immigration Appeal Tribunal was justified, and indeed obliged, not to refer to the wording of the Convention. On 11 February 1988 further leave to appeal to the House of Lords was refused by the House of Lords Appeal Committee. COMPLAINTS The applicant complains that his proposed deportation from the United Kingdom to Tanzania is in breach of Articles 8 and 13 (Art. 8, Art. 13) of the Convention. The applicant contends that if he is deported he ""will be permanently separated from his mother and father.  The only country to which he could realistically go would be Tanzania, but out of his immediate family circle only he is a Tanzanian national.  There is no legal obligation on Tanzania to admit either his father (a British Protected Person) or his mother (an Indian national).  Further the family left in circumstances of some persecution and it is not realistic to expect a return by the mother and the father.  The father is in poor health and dependent upon the applicant as a bread-winner; if the applicant is removed both parents face old age without a major part of the family support they have had to date in the United Kingdom.  The applicant's wife would be placed in an intolerable position.  She has no contact at all with Tanzania.  The applicant does not know whether she will be admitted to Tanzania.  The applicant's daughter is a British citizen and is now aged 7.  The life of the present, close, extended family will be destroyed if the applicant is to be removed."" As regards Article 8 (Art.8) of the Convention the applicant contends that his family life will be severed as his family cannot follow him to Tanzania.  His deportation is disproportionate in the circumstances.  He has led a sober and industrious life with the exception of the drug offence.  He supports his whole family. Tanzania is a strange culture to him and a place where he has no friends or relatives.  His removal would constitute a further punishment of banishment and is not necessary for the prevention of crime in the sense of preventing further offences as there is no evidence that he will ever offend again or that his removal will have a deterrent effect on potential offenders.  He points out that the criminal court did not recommend his deportation and that the offence involved cannabis, not a life threatening drug like heroin. The applicant also claims that Article 13 (Art. 13), both read alone and together with Article 8 (Art. 8), is breached in his case because the English legal system fails to provide an adequate remedy for the alleged breach of Article 8 (Art. 8) of the Convention.  The applicant submits that the domestic court decisions in this case, in particular the opinion of Glidewell LJ in the Court of Appeal (p. 5 above), reveal that the immigration authorities are not entitled to take the Convention into account.  They cannot, therefore, provide an adequate remedy. The applicant draws the following conclusions from the domestic court judgments in his case: (i)    the Home Secretary is not entitled to consider whether removal of an immigrant can be said to be necessary in a democratic society for the prevention of crime.  The Convention case-law elucidating the concept is simply irrelevant to his considerations; (ii)    it follows that the Home Secretary will never form his own view as to those measures which can properly be said to be a proportionate response to a pressing social need; (iii)   the Convention cannot have any role at all in changing the mind of an administrator, because he is not allowed to look at it; (iv)    there is no mechanism for giving effect to a decision of the Strasbourg Court without primary legislation; if the Secretary of State cannot have regard to the Convention, he equally cannot have regard to a judgment of the Court, which has no force other than that conferred by the Convention itself. The applicant contends that inherent in the concept of an adequate remedy under Article 13 (Art. 13) is the ability to draw to the attention of the relevant domestic authority the possibility that a given administrative action might create a breach of the Convention and should be avoided or reversed for that reason.  The ability to do so was denied the applicant and in the present state of English law cannot be granted to anyone complaining of the manner of exercise of a statutory discretion, whether in immigration or any other field. It is further submitted that the operation of United Kingdom domestic law, as it must take place following the Court of Appeal decision herein, is inimical to the proper functioning of the Convention.  The essence of the concept of a ""margin of appreciation"" is that domestic authorities themselves consider the matters in the light of Convention obligations, and provide, if necessary, material by which the Commission and the Court can judge whether or not the relevant exercise of administrative discretion falls within the margin of appreciation.  If the domestic authorities cannot look at the Convention, this exercise cannot be undertaken. THE LAW 1.      The applicant has complained that his proposed deportation from the United Kingdom to Tanzania is in breach of his right to respect for family life. The relevant part of Article 8 (Art. 8) of the Convention provides as follows: ""1.  Everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life,... 2.  There shall be no interference by a public authority with the exercise of this right except such as is in accordance with the law and is necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security, public safety or the economic well-being of the country, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others."" Whilst the Convention does not guarantee a right, as such, to enter or remain in a particular country, the Commission has constantly held that the exclusion of a person from a country where his close relatives reside may raise an issue under Article 8 (Art. 8) of the Convention (e.g.  No. 7816/77, Dec. 19.5.77, D.R. 9 p. 219; No. 9088/80, Dec.6.3.82, D.R. 28 p. 160 and No. 9285/81, Dec. 6.7.82, D.R. 29 p. 205). In the present case, the Commission notes that the applicant's parents, wife and children have indefinite leave to reside in the United Kingdom (his eldest child is a British citizen).  However, the applicant has been convicted of a serious drugs' offence which, according to the British Immigration authorities, render his deportation ""conducive to the public good"", within the meaning of Section 3(5)(b) of the Immigration Act 1971.  These authorities have carefully considered the applicant's family circumstances and the fact that the applicant and his wife do not have particularly strong ties with the United Kingdom.  The Commission also notes that the applicant has not shown that his wife and children would not be entitled to join him in Tanzania or that his parents could  not manage financially without him in the United Kingdom if they decided not to follow him back to Tanzania.  The applicant's mother is employed and has an income.  She also owns half of the family business.  The Commission does not find that the deportation decision necessarily involves the break up of the whole family or that the establishment of a new home would pose insuperable difficulties for the young couple. Thus, while the Commission considers that the proposed deportation of the applicant constitutes an interference with the applicant's family life under Article 8 para. 1 (Art. 8-1) of the Convention, the Commission must, in considering whether that interference was justified under Article 8 para. 2 (Art. 8-2), attach significant weight to the aforementioned factual circumstances, in particular the serious drug offence. The Commission concludes, therefore, that the said interference, which was in accordance with British immigration law, was justified as being ""necessary in a democratic society ... for the prevention of disorder and crime, (and) for the protection of health"", within the meaning of Article 8 para. 2 (Art. 8-2) of the Convention. It follows that this aspect of the applicant's case is manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 27 para. 2 (Art. 27-2) of the Convention. 2.      The applicant has also complained that he had no effective domestic remedy at his disposal for his Article 8 (Art. 8) complaint.  He claims thereby to be a victim of a breach of Article 13 (Art. 13) of the Convention which provides as follows: ""Everyone whose rights and freedoms as set forth in this Convention are violated shall have an effective remedy before a national authority notwithstanding that the violation has been committed by persons acting in an official capacity."" The Commission refers to the constant case-law of the Convention organs that ""neither Article 13 (Art. 13) nor the Convention in general lays down for the Contracting States any given manner for ensuring within their internal law the effective implementation of any of the provisions of the Convention"" (Eur.  Court H.R., Swedish Engine Drivers' Union judgment of 6 February 1976, Series A No. 20 para. 50). Thus the Contracting Parties do not have to incorporate the Convention into the domestic law, but, if they do not, they must give effect to its substance and provide domestic remedies to enforce effectively the equivalent rights and freedoms in domestic law (Eur.  Court H.R., Lithgow and Others judgment of 8 July 1986, Series A No. 102 para. 205). The Commission notes that the Convention is not part of British domestic law.  However, it does not accept the applicant's contention that he had no effective domestic remedies before the British immigration authorities and courts just because they were not obliged by domestic law to take the provisions of Article 8 (Art. 8) of the Convention directly into account when examining his case.  The Commission finds that, in the present case, the examination by the domestic authorities of whether the applicant's criminal conviction rendered his deportation ""conducive to the public good"", pursuant to Section 3(5)(b) of the Immigration Act 1971, account being taken of all relevant circumstances, including the compassionate circumstances arising from his family situation, in substance was a similar exercise to the examination of whether his deportation was ""necessary in a democratic society ... for the prevention of disorder or crime, (and) for the protection of health"", within the meaning of Article 8 para. 2 (Art. 8-2) of the Convention.  In the light of these considerations, the Commission concludes that the applicant had an effective remedy for the purposes of Article 13 (Art. 13) of the Convention in his appeal against deportation before the independent Immigration Appeal Tribunal, and in the judicial review of the Tribunal's decision by the High Court and the Court of Appeal. It follows that this aspect of the applicant's case is also manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 27 para. 2 (Art. 27-2) of the Convention. For these reasons, the Commission DECLARES THE APPLICATION INADMISSIBLE. Secretary to the Commission       President of the Commission (H.C. KRÜGER)                    (C.A. NØRGAARD)",,

KRÜGER Secretary to the Commission Having regard to Article 25 (Art. 25) of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms; Having regard to the application introduced on 30 June 1988 by Fadma EL BELHAJI against the Netherlands and registered on 11 July 1988 under file No. 14014/88; Having regard to the report provided for in Rule 40 of the Rules of Procedure of the Commission; Having deliberated; Decides as follows: THE FACTS The facts as submitted by the applicant may be summarised as follows: The applicant is a Moroccan citizen born in 1956 in Ijarmauas, Morocco.  She is unemployed and at present residing in Amsterdam, the Netherlands.  Before the Commission she is represented by M.D. van ALLER, a lawyer practising in Amsterdam. The applicant is the third of nine children.  Her father left Morocco in 1965 and was granted a residence permit in the Netherlands on 8 December 1978.  He continued to support his family financially. On 1 September 1982 the applicant's mother and the five youngest children joined the father in the Netherlands.  The applicant was required to remain in Morocco to tend to her sick grandmother.  She was financially supported by her father. In February 1985 the grandmother died.  Apparently, according to Moroccan law, the applicant was obliged to go and live with her father, because he is still her legal guardian. On approximately 3 October 1985 the applicant arrived in the Netherlands.  On 11 February 1986 she applied for a residence permit for the purpose of living with her parents.  This was denied on the same day.  A request for a revision was denied by the Deputy Minister of Justice on 3 June 1986. On 15 February 1988 the Council of State (Raad van State) rejected her appeal.  It considered that the applicant's ties with her family in the Netherlands had been broken, so that she did not meet the requirements under Dutch law for a residence permit.  Her appeal for a residence permit on humanitarian grounds, in which she stated that, for both legal and religious reasons, she could not live alone in Morocco, was rejected.  The Council of State considered that, inter alia, in view of her age and the fact that she had always lived in Morocco, there was no reason to assume that she would not be able to establish a reasonable, independent existence for herself in Morocco. The applicant has been informed that she will have to leave the Netherlands, but no expulsion decision has as yet been taken. COMPLAINTS The applicant complains that she is not capable of living on her own in Morocco.  The applicant has never been to school and has never had a job.  She has always been dependent on her father. Furthermore, a woman living alone in Morocco is considered to be immoral, and in rural communities a woman is not allowed in the streets unaccompanied.  She contends that by expelling her the Netherlands will be condemning her to a miserable existence.  She invokes Article 3 (Art. 3) of the Convention in this regard. Furthermore, the applicant complains that the Netherlands has erroneously found that she is no longer a part of her father's family.  She contends that her expulsion violates her right to a family life.  She invokes Article 8 para. 1 (Art. 8-1) of the Convention in this regard. THE LAW The applicant has complained that by expelling her to Morocco the Netherlands will be condemning her to a miserable existence.  By forcing her to live as a single woman in Morocco, the Netherlands will be treating her inhumanly in violation of Article 3 (Art. 3) of the Convention. The Commisison first recalls that according to its established case-law the right to asylum and the freedom from expulsion are not as such included among the rights and freedoms mentioned in the Convention but that the expulsion of a person may nevertheless, in certain exceptional circumstances, raise an issue under the Convention and in particular under Article 3 (Art. 3) where there are serious grounds to fear that the person concerned would be subjected, in the State to which he is to be sent, to treatment which is in violation of this Article (see e.g.  No. 1802/62, Dec. 26.3.63, Yearbook 6 pp. 462, 480; No. 10308/83, Dec. 3.5.84, D.R. 36 pp. 209, 231;  No. 10564/83, Dec. 10.12.84, D.R. 40 pp. 262, 265). In the present case, however, the applicant is an adult woman and her complaint is that she will have a difficult life on her own in Morocco.  She has not submitted that she can expect to receive any sort of physical harm in Morocco. In these circumstances, the Commission finds that the envisaged expulsion to Morocco cannot raise an issue under Article 3 (Art. 3) of the Convention. It follows that the applicant's complaint in respect of the Netherlands regarding a violation of Article 3 (Art. 3) of the Convention must be rejected as manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 27 para. 2 (Art. 27-2) of the Convention. Furthermore, the applicant has complained that her imminent expulsion interferes with her right to respect for her family life. She has invoked Article 8 (Art. 8) of the Convention.  This article provides as follows: ""1.  Everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life, his home and his correspondence. 2.    There shall be no interference by a public authority with the exercise of this right except such as is in accordance with the law and is necessary in a democratic society in the interest of national security, public safety or the economic well-being of the country, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, or for  the protection of the rights and freedoms of others."" The Commission recalls that the Convention does not guarantee a right to enter or reside in a particular country.  However, the Commission has also held that, in view of the right to respect for family life ensured by Article 8 (Art. 8) of the Convention, the expulsion of a person from a country in which his close relatives reside may raise an issue under this provision of the Convention (cf. e.g.  No. 7816/79, Dec. 19.5.77, D.R. 9 p. 219 and No. 845/78, Dec. 6.5.81, D.R. 24 p. 98). In such cases, the Commission first examines whether such a degree of dependency exists between the applicant and her relatives as to give rise to the protection envisaged by Article 8 (Art. 8) of the Convention (cf.  Nos. 9214/80, 9473/81, 9474/81, Dec. 11.5.82, D.R. 29 p. 176). The Commission notes that the applicant lived in Morocco with her mother and younger brothers and sisters until September 1982. Between 1982 and 1985 she tended to her grandmother at the behest of her family.  During this time she was supported by her father.  Since October 1985 she has again been living with her family, in the Netherlands. In these circumstances the Commission is satisfied that there is family life between the applicant and her father, mother and younger brothers and sisters, within the meaning of Article 8 para. 1 (Art. 8-1) of the Convention.  Consequently, the applicant's intended expulsion can be considered as an interference with her right to respect for family life. The question which remains to be examined is whether this interference was justified under the second paragraph of Article 8 (Art. 8) of the Convention. The Commission notes that the decision to refuse the applicant a residence permit was taken on the basis of Dutch immigration policy which lays down special conditions for the granting of residence permits on the grounds of family reunification. The Commission notes that the Dutch immigration policy establishes these special conditions for the purpose of regulating the labour market, and generally to restrict immigration into a densely populated country.  Thus, the legitimate aim pursued is the preservation of the country's economic well-being, within the meaning of paragraph 2 of Article 8 (Art. 8) of the Convention (see Eur.  Court H.R., Berrehab judgment of 21 June 1988, to be published in Series A no. 138, para. 26). In the present case the applicant had lived in Morocco until she was 29 years old.  She had not lived with her father since 1965. She was capable of taking care of her sick grandmother between 1982 and 1985, although she was supported by her father.  She is at present 32 years old and has older brothers and/or sisters in Morocco. A special feature of the present case is the applicant's assertion that, for religious and cultural reasons, she will have difficulty in living alone in Morocco.  Despite this humanitarian aspect of the case, the Commission considers that, in the circumstances and in view of the applicant's age, respect for her family life does not outweigh valid considerations relating to Dutch immigration policy. The Commission considers, therefore, that the interference cannot be said to be disporportionate to the legitimate aim pursued and is justified as necessary in a democratic society within the meaning of Article 8 para. 2 (Art. 8-2) of the Convention. It follows that the application must be rejected as being manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 27 para. 2 (Art. 27-2) of the Convention. For these reasons, the Commisison DECLARES THE APPLICATION INADMISSIBLE. Secretary to the Commisison              President of the Commission (H.C. KRÜGER)                            (C.A.

NØRGAARD, President S. TRECHSEL F. ERMACORA E. BUSUTTIL G. JÖRUNDSSON A.S. GÖZÜBÜYÜK A. WEITZEL J.C. SOYER H.G. SCHERMERS H. DANELIUS G. BATLINER H. VANDENBERGHE Mrs.  G.H.

KRÜGER, Secretary to the Commission Having regard to Article 25 (Art. 25) of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms; Having regard to the application introduced on 3 May 1985 by TIMOTHY CROOK and THE NATIONAL UNION OF JOURNALISTS against the United Kingdom and registered on 23 May 1985 under file No. 11552/85; Having regard to the report provided for in Rule 40 of the Rules of Procedure of the Commission; Having deliberated; Decides as follows: THE FACTS The first applicant, Mr.  Timothy Crook, is a citizen of the United Kingdom, born in 1959, and at present residing in London.  He is a journalist by profession and the proprietor of a newsagency which provides reports of court trials for the broadcast media. The second applicant, the National Union of Journalists, is a trade union representing the interests of British journalists, many of whom are professionally engaged in court reporting. The applicants were represented by Ms.  Marie Staunton and Mr.  Paul Hunt, Legal Officers, National Council for Civil Liberties. The facts submitted by the applicants may be summarised as follows. In the course of a trial which took place in the Central Criminal Court, London, in January 1984 in which three defendants were charged inter alia with abducting a woman in order that she should have unlawful sexual intercourse with another person, an application was made to the court for an Order under Section 11 of the Contempt of Court Act 1981 prohibiting the publication of the victim's name. The trial judge, after hearing representations from counsel for the defence, subsequently made an Order under Section 11 ""prohibiting publication of her name or any material leading to her identity or identification"".  He added, however, that the name could be referred to in court since withholding it might prejudice the defence of one or more of the defendants. In the course of the trial it transpired that the witness belonged to a well-known family and it was suggested to the court by counsel for the defence that the real reason that counsel made an application for an Order under Section 11 was to shield her and her family from embarrassment arising from certain details of her past which were revealed in the course of her evidence.  After receiving a request from journalists to reconsider the Order the trial judge agreed to hear representations from the media in view of the ""constitutional importance of the Section 11 Order"". After hearing counsel on behalf of the media and counsel for the witness, the trial judge in a decision dated 27 January 1984 upheld his Order under Section 11.  He found that the court did have a power at common law to make such an Order notwithstanding that the indictment was not one of blackmail.  He also found, on a question of construction of Section 11, that it was open to him to make an Order notwithstanding the fact that thereafter, in the course of the trial, the name of the witness could  be referred to in court. Further he held that the Order was justified in the interests of the administration of justice.  In reaching this conclusion he took into account that the witness, now 23, had started to take heroin when she was 17.  She had subsequently become an addict and had then sought assistance for treatment and he referred to medical evidence given before him to the effect that people seeking rehabilitation by treatment must avoid undue stress. In an application for judicial review of this Order the Divisional Court found that it had no jurisdiction to entertain the application for the Order since Section 29 of the Supreme Court Act 1981 had the effect of excluding any review of an Order made in the course of proceedings at a Crown Court trial. The judges of the Divisional Court indicated that they had reached their conclusion reluctantly and expressed the view that the Order was wholly illogical since the name of the witness was used freely in the court in a public hearing and would thus be known to any persons sitting in the public gallery.  Moreover they expressed doubt that the trial judge had power to make the Order under Section 11 where the name of the witness would be referred to in court during the course of the proceedings. The court also objected to the trial judge's hearing of representations from the media and from counsel on behalf of a witness, holding that no person who was not a party to the trial had standing to oppose an Order made by the trial judge however much they might be affected by it.  The proper procedure to be followed in future cases was for counsel for the prosecution or the defence to make representations on behalf of the aggrieved party. COMPLAINTS The applicants complained that since the name of the witness was regularly referred to in open court, the Order was an infringement of their freedom to impart information to the public and thus a breach of Article 10 (Art. 10) of the Convention. Furthermore the decision of the Divisional Court that persons in their position in the future have no right to oppose Orders made under the Contempt of Court Act 1981 deprives them of their entitlement to a fair hearing contrary to Article 6 (Art. 6) in relation to decisions which affect their civil rights. Finally, they submitted that the lack of an effective remedy against the Section 11 Order constitutes a breach of Article 13 (Art. 13) of the Convention. PROCEEDINGS BEFORE THE COMMISSION The application was introduced on 3 May 1985 and was registered on 23 May 1985.  It was first considered by the Commission on 2 December 1985 when it was decided to communicate the application to the respondent Government and to request their observations on the admissibility and merits of the case. In a letter dated 9 April 1986 the Government informed the Commission that they had approached the applicant's legal advisers (National Council for Civil Liberties) with a view to discussing possible changes in the law concerning review of Orders made under inter alia Section 11 of the Contempt of Court Act 1981.  The Commission was requested to adjourn the application pending the outcome of these discussions.  In a further letter of 14 July 1986 the Government indicated that they intended to change the law in order to permit judicial review but that the manner in which review would take place was a matter for further discussion. On 14 July 1986 the Commission again considered the application and decided to adjourn it pending the outcome of the discussions between the parties. A meeting subsequently took place in London on 18 March 1988 between the parties and the Secretary to the Commission, accompanied by a member of the Secretariat. In a letter dated 7 July 1988, the Agent of the respondent Government, Mr.  M. C. Wood, made the following proposals: ""1.  The Government have tabled an amendment to the Criminal Justice Bill which, inter alia, provides that any person aggrieved may, with leave, appeal to the Court of Appeal against an order under section 4 or 11 of the Contempt of Court Act 1981 made in relation to a trial on indictment. It is now intended that ... the time limit for the appeal should be fourteen days, with the usual possibility of applying for leave to appeal out of time. 2.   Provided that the above application is struck off the Commission's list of cases, the Government are ready to pay the costs that would have been payable on the party and party basis to the applicants if they had succeeded before the Divisional Court and, in addition, a proportion (75%) of the legal costs relating to the application to the Commission which have been actually incurred, necessarily incurred and are reasonable as to quantum."" Mr.  P. Hunt, Legal Officer, National Council for Civil Liberties, indicated in a telex dated 11 July 1988 that the applicants were prepared to withdraw the application on the terms set out in Mr.  Wood's letter of 7 July 1988. REASONS FOR THE DECISION The Commission notes that the applicants complained inter alia under Articles 10 and 13 (Art. 10, Art. 13) of the Convention in respect of an Order made under Section 11 of the Contempt of Court Act 1981 restraining them from publishing the name of a witness in a criminal trial.  It further notes that the Government proposed an amendment to the Criminal Justice Bill, providing for the possibility of an appeal to the Court of Appeal against Orders made under Section 11 of the 1981 Act.  The applicants have indicated their willingness to withdraw the application in the light of this proposal. Against this background, the Commission finds that the parties have reached a settlement of the application and, having regard to Rule 44(1) of the Rules of Procedure, that there are no reasons relating to the general interest to continue an examination of the application. For these reasons, the Commission DECIDES TO STRIKE THE APPLICATION OFF ITS LIST OF CASES. Secretary to the Commission            President of the Commission (H. C.

KRÜGER, Secretary to the Commission Having regard to Article 25 (Art. 25) of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms; Having regard to the application introduced on 21 November 1985 by Gerarda Elka VAN DER LINDEN VOOREN against the Netherlands and registered on 13 March 1986 under file No. 12049/86; Having regard to the report provided for in Rule 40 of the Rules of Procedure of the Commission; Having deliberated; Decides as follows: THE FACTS The applicant is a Dutch citizen, born on 1 May 1964, living in Amsterdam.  In the proceedings before the Commission she is represented by her grandfather, Mr.  P. Brouwer, who lives in Halsteren, the Netherlands. In 1977 the applicant inherited, together with her brother or sister, a business concern which owned and let the rooms of a large house in Amsterdam.  As of 1 February 1982, the applicant's guardian let the house on lease because it needed renovation.  Shortly before that date, the last tenants had left the house. On 14 or 15 March 1982, by which date the renovation of the house had not yet been completed, the house was occupied by squatters. Both the leaseholder and the applicant's guardian reported this to the police and to the Public Prosecutor who refused to prosecute the squatters, apparently on the ground that the house was not, at the time of the squatting, in actual use.  This criterion was used in accordance with the Dutch Supreme Court's jurisprudence on Section 138 of the Dutch Penal Code, which qualifies breach of domicile as a criminal offence.  The Public Prosecutor told the leaseholder and the guardian by the end of March 1982 that their case was  civil and not criminal.  However, civil proceedings could not be instituted against the squatters, because their identity was not known. Having found that it was not possible to evict the squatters without the help of the police, the guardian and the leaseholder then decided to use a special legal construction in order to circumvent the deadlock caused by the anonymity of the squatters:  the leaseholder instituted summary civil proceedings before the President of the Amsterdam Regional Court against the guardian, claiming that the latter had to put the house, in an empty state, at his disposal.  On 28 June 1982, the President granted the claims and authorised the leaseholder to have the premises vacated, if necessary with police assistance. The President's judgment was not executed, however, apparently because neither the leaseholder nor the guardian had sufficient financial resources to pay the bailiff, who had asked for 10.000 guilders to vacate the house.  Also for financial reasons, no summary civil proceedings under Section 1401 of the Civil Code were instituted against the Head of the local Police, the Mayor of Amsterdam, in order to obtain police assistance in moving out the squatters.  The availability of this remedy in squatting cases, developed and accepted by Dutch courts since 1981, was endorsed by the Supreme Court (Hoge Raad) on 21 January 1983 (NJ 1983, 252). It appears that around July 1982, the lease had been cancelled because the leaseholder had not paid the rent and had gone bankrupt.  The cancellation apparently constituted an additional hindrance to the execution of the judgment of 28 June 1982. At some later date, a new guardian was appointed who asked the Mayor of Amsterdam, in his letters of 21 August 1984 and 8 January 1985, to co-operate in the removal of the squatters from the house. Similar letters to the Mayor were written by the present representative of the applicant, one of which is dated 6 August 1985. Apparently, the Mayor did not answer any of these letters.  Requests to have the names of the squatters forwarded by the police to the applicant's representative were not answered either. On 19 January 1985, the applicant's representative asked the Public Prosecutor to prosecute the squatters under, inter alia, Section 138 of the Penal Code.  On 26 March 1985, the Public Prosecutor answered that there was no reason for prosecution since the case was of a civil character.  He referred to the judgment of the President of the Regional Court. On 18 March 1985, the applicant's representative filed a complaint, under Section 12 of the Code of Penal Procedure, against this refusal to prosecute with the Amsterdam Court of Appeal.  At that time, he did not possess a written authority to act on behalf of the applicant.  On 2 September 1986, the Court of Appeal considered that this omission was covered by the fact that an authority had been given on 1 August 1985.  The Court held, contrary to the findings of the Public Prosecutor, that there exists serious suspicion that the squatters are guilty of breach of domicile.  However, the Court found that it was not expedient to order prosecution since the Public Prosecutor's refusal to prosecute dated from March 1982 and three years had elapsed before a complaint was filed with the Court. At the end of 1985, the applicant's guardian sold the house to an estate agent, apparently for a low price because of the presence of the squatters. COMPLAINTS The applicant alleges a violation of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1. (P1-1) She complains that the Dutch authorities, by refusing to remove the squatters from her house, have not guaranteed to her the peaceful enjoyment of her possessions. THE LAW The applicant has complained that the Dutch authorities were unwilling to co-operate, through police assistance, in the removal of the squatters from her house. It is true that Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (P1-1) of the Convention secures to everyone the right to peaceful enjoyment of his possessions. However, the Commission is not required to decide whether or not the facts alleged by the applicant disclose any appearance of a violation of this provision as, under Article 26 (Art. 26) of the Convention, it may only deal with a matter after all domestic remedies have been exhausted according to the generally recognised rules of international law. In the present case the applicant failed to institute civil proceedings under Section 1401 of the Civil Code against the Mayor of Amsterdam claiming that he order the police to put an end to the occupation of the applicant's house. It is true that the applicant claims that she had not sufficient financial means to start civil proceedings against the Mayor of Amsterdam.  However, she has failed to substantiate this claim.  Neither has she shown that she or her guardian has applied for free legal aid.  Moreover, an examination of the case as it has been submitted does not disclose the existence of any other special circumstances which might have absolved the applicant, according to the generally recognised rules of international law, from exhausting the domestic remedies at her disposal. It follows that the applicant has not complied with the condition as to the exhaustion of domestic remedies and her application must in this respect be rejected under Article 27 para. 3 (Art. 27-3) of the Convention.

They are married and the second applicant suffers from ill-health. The facts as submitted by the applicants may be summarised as follows. The applicants are owners of eleven acres of ground in Upper Bodington.  In 1978, they moved into a caravan on the holding, where they keep a herd of twenty-five beef cattle.  They pay domestic rates in relation to their occupation of the caravan. In May 1978, the South Northamptonshire District Council (hereafter ""the Council"") served an enforcement notice on the applicants alleging an unauthorised change of use from agricultural purposes to use as a site for a caravan contrary to the Town and Country Planning Act 1971 and requiring the applicants to remove the caravan.  The applicants' appeal against the notice was dismissed in April 1979.  The applicants then moved the caravan to an area of their land omitted from the scope of the notice. In January 1980 a second enforcement notice was served concerning the whole of the holding.  The applicants appeal was dismissed on 6 November 1980, although the planning inspector found the proper description of the present user was dual, for agricultural purposes and as a site for a caravan, and gave the applicants six months to remove their caravan.  He also found that the caravan detracted from the visual amenities of the area of open countryside beyond the village. The applicants then apparently moved the caravan on to land adjacent to their holding and, on 15 January 1982, a third enforcement notice was served concerning the new site of the caravan.  The applicants appealed and their appeal was heard before a planning inspector.  In a decision dated 2 September 1982, the inspector found the Council had erred in the terms of their notice, which was accordingly reworded to require removal of a residential caravan, a caravan used for agricultural purposes not involving any change of user.  The inspector found that the caravan detracted from the rural amenities and was contrary to policy.  Under the question of special need he took into consideration the age of the applicants and their wish to continue to manage their holding but found that the size and nature of their farming activity was not such as to require them to reside permanently on the site.  He therefore dismissed the applicants' appeal and they were given nine months to remove the caravan. The applicants, at a date unknown, returned the caravan on to their holding.  On 5 December 1983, the Council issued three summons, alleging breach of each of the three enforcement notices.  These were heard separately before the magistrates court and dismissed.  On 13 June 1984, two further summonses were issued in relation to the first two notices but these were either withdrawn or dismissed at a hearing before the magistrates' court on 4 November 1984. A third set of summonses was issued and on 22 May 1985 the first applicant was found guilty and fined £250 in respect of the summons relating to the 1980 notice.  The first applicant appealed to the Crown Court on the grounds that the prosecution was unjust and oppressive.  The first applicant's counsel sought to make the point that when the notice was issued, in the event of a prosecution, the notice could have been challenged on the basis that the steps required to be taken exceeded what was necessary to remedy any breach of planning control, namely, while the local authority could require the applicants to cease residential use of the caravan, it had no power to require removal of the caravan.  However, due to a subsequent legislative amendment in 1981, this method of challenge was no longer available and counsel argued that the local authority were bringing a prosecution in respect of a notice which they knew to be invalid but the invalidity of which the applicant was now precluded from challenging.  The first applicant's appeal was dismissed by the Crown Court on 11 October 1985. The local authority proceeded to seek an injunction against the applicants to enforce the removal of the caravan.  Their application was heard before the High Court on 30 March 1987 and an injunction was granted, requiring the applicants to remove the caravan by 30 June 1987. In his judgment, the judge stated that the grant of an injunction was a discretionary remedy and he took into consideration the applicants' age, health and the history of the case in deciding whether to exercise his discretion in granting an injunction.  The judge also considered again the argument of the applicants' counsel that the prosecution was based on an invalid notice but came to the conclusion that there was no substance in this.  He found that the applicants had acted in breach of the relevant legislation and that there was no evidence that the local authority had not acted in good faith or that it had been actuated by anything other than proper planning considerations in refusing planning permission to the applicants.  He concluded: ""... as was explained by counsel for the plaintiff, the plaintiff Council have taken the administrative view that the best course here in everybody's interests would be to come to this court for an injunction rather than to put Mr. and Mrs.  Lay to the trouble and expense and harassment of a whole series of prosecutions in the magistrates' court. They seek to have the matter determined once and for all by the injunction, and I am bound to say, in the light of all the circumstances known to me, that is a very understandable decision to take.  It seems to me I ought not to refuse an injunction in the circumstances of this case, the Council itself now standing in the place of the Attorney General, merely because all other remedies have not been exhausted. But what of the other matters?  I am painfully aware that the order restraining - or the effect of which is to restrain Mr. and Mrs.  Lay from living in the caravan on their own land is going to cause them very great distress.  It is going to put them, temporarily at any rate, in very great difficulties with regard to housing.  They are old.  They are not well.  They have persuaded themselves, wrongly I think, that they are being persecuted.  Weighing all these matters and the observations in Mr.  Scott's opinion as best I can I come to the conclusion that this is a case in which it would be right to make an order very broadly in the terms sought by the Council.  I think it is a case for an injunction which is fully made out, and in the exercise of the court's discretion I propose to make an order."" The applicants did not move the caravan and the local authority applied to the High Court for an order to enter and remove the caravan.  The applicants were unable to attend the hearing on 10 December 1987 due to ill-health when the application was granted, but were allowed to re-apply to the Court.  Having been refused legal aid, the applicants attended the High Court in person on 11 January 1988.  After representations from both parties, the judge held that he maintained the order. During the course of these proceedings the applicants applied on two occasions for planning permission to build a cottage on their land, on the site of a previous cottage which was in ruins.  Their applications were refused on 3 October 1981 and 4 July 1985 on the grounds that it would have constituted an unjustifiable extension of development and intrusion into the open countryside beyond the approved village framework. By letter dated 22 January 1988, the applicants were informed by the Council's housing officer that they were considered as falling within a priority group for the purposes of housing.  He mentioned that the Council had already made 2 offers of alternative accommodation which the applicants had refused but that the Council were willing to offer a third possibility, namely, a 2 bedroomed bungalow in Litchborough.  By letter in reply, the applicants explained that they had refused the first offer because it concerned a house with steep stairs  and the second because it concerned a property 20 miles from their land, which would have caused them great difficulties in continuing to manage their holding.  The applicants refused the third offer on the same grounds, the bungalow in question being situated 12-14 miles from their land. COMPLAINTS The applicants complain that the Council is threatening to remove the caravan in which they live from their land.  The applicants complain that the Council has treated them unjustly and oppressively. They submit that the Council has granted permission to others to build or have caravans on land outside the perimeter of the village: they refer in particular to 3 farmers who were granted permission to build housing on their land overside the village, which they then sold for six-figure sums of money.  They complain that the third accommodation offered is unsuitable, since it is situated 12-14 miles from their holding and would cause them great difficulties in continuing to farm their land. THE LAW 1.      The applicants complain that the Council is threatening to remove the caravan in which they live from their land.  They also complain of being refused permission to build on their land although permission has been granted to others.  The Commission has examined these complaints under Articles 8 and 14 (Art. 8, Art. 14) of the Convention and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (P1-1) to the Convention. 2.      Article 8 (Art. 8) of the Convention provides that: ""1.     Everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life, his home and his correspondence. 2.      There shall be no interference by a public authority with the exercise of this right except such as is in accordance with the law and is necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security, public safety or the economic well-being of the country, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others."" The Commission finds that the caravan in question, which the applicants have lived in since 1978, must be considered as their ""home"" and that the enforcement procedure pursued by the Council to remove their caravan constitutes an interference with the applicants' right to respect for their home. The Commission must therefore consider whether this interference is ""in accordance with the law"" and whether it is ""necessary in a democratic society"" for one or more of the reasons listed in paragraph 2 of Article 8 (Art. 8-2) of the Convention. The Commission recalls that the applicants had not obtained planning permission for using their land as a site for a residential caravan and that this use was accordingly unauthorised.  The Council, which served enforcement notices and issued summonses alleging breach of these notices, was acting in implementation of the relevant planning legislation.  The Commission notes that, although the Council apparently made various procedural errors in the course of the proceedings, the first applicant was found guilty of breach of an enforcement notice, by a magistrates court and ordered to remove the caravan.  His appeal against this decision was dismissed.  Further on 30 March 1987 the injunction requiring removal of the caravan and the order permitting the Council to enter and remove the caravan were made by the High Court.  The Commission accordingly finds that the enforcement procedure was ""in accordance with the law"". The Commission also finds that the interference pursues a legitimate aim, namely, the protection of the rights of others through the operation of planning controls which is recognised as necessary in a democratic society throughout the member States of the Council of Europe.  The Commission recalls that in previous case-law it has recognised that the existence and operation of planning controls which delimit areas where domestic development may be extended is a legitimate measure to protect the amenity value of rural areas and thereby to protect the rights of others (see No. 11185/84, Dec. 11.3.85, to be published in D.R. 42). It remains to be examined whether the interference was ""necessary in a democratic society"" for this legitimate aim.  In making the assessment of the necessity of a given interference the national authorities enjoy a margin of appreciation.  It is established case-law that an interference with a Convention right cannot be regarded as ""necessary"" unless it is proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued (see e.g.  Eur.  Court H.R., Gillow judgment of 24 November 1986, Series A no. 109, p. 22, para. 55).  Concerning the necessity and the proportionality of the measures, the Commission recalls that the applicants moved on to their land in their caravan without obtaining permission for the change of user and that it was found by the planning inspectors in the various appeals that the caravan detracted from the visual amenities of the rural landscape outside the village area.  The Commission recalls that the inspector, in the decision dated 2 September 1982, took into consideration the age of the applicants and their desire to farm the land but found that the size and nature of their farming activity was not such as to render it essential for anyone to reside on the site.  The Commission further recalls that the Council has endeavoured to find alternative accommodation for the applicants, although the applicants have so far rejected these offers on the basis, inter alia, that the housing was situated too far away from their land. The Commission notes that the position of the applicants was also considered by the High Court, when on 30 March 1987, it decided whether to grant the local authority an injunction to enforce the removal of the caravan.  The judgment of the court took into account the age and circumstances of the applicants and the possible legal arguments in their favour but found that the applicants had acted in breach of the planning legislation and that there was no evidence that the local authority had been actuated by other than proper planning considerations in refusing planning permission.  Having weighed all these matters, the court decided to grant the injunction. In light of these circumstances and in particular the fact that the use of the land for residential purposes was originally illegal, the Commission finds that the measures taken can be considered as ""necessary in a democratic society"". The Commission therefore finds that the interference in the present case is justified under paragraph 2 of Article 8 (Art. 8-2) of the Convention and that this part of the application must be rejected as manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 27 para. 2 (Art. 27-2) of the Convention. 3.      Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (P1-1) to the Convention provides: ""Every natural or legal person is entitled to the peaceful enjoyment of his possessions.  No one shall be deprived of his possessions except in the public interest and subject to the conditions provided for by law and by the general principles of international law. The preceding provisions shall not, however, in any way impair the right of a State to enforce such laws as it deems necessary to control the use of property in accordance with the general interest or to secure the payment of taxes or other contributions or penalties."" Insofar as the applicants complain of the enforcement proceedings which endeavour to remove their caravan from their land, the Commission finds that this amounts to a control of use of property within the meaning of the second paragraph of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (P1-1).  However, even assuming that the applicants have complied with the six months time-limit provided for in Article 26 (Art. 26) of the Convention, the Commission considers that this control of use of the land is necessary in accordance with the general interest of safeguarding rural areas from unsuitable development.  The Commission refers in this respect to its reasons given above in the context of Article 8 (Art. 8) of the Convention, the requirements of which are more stringent than those of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (P1-1). The Commission finds that an examination under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (P1-1) of this aspect of the applicants' complaints does not disclose any appearance of a violation of this provision.  It follows that, in this respect, the application is manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 27 para. 2 (Art. 27-2) of the Convention. 4.      It is true that the applicants have also complained that they were discriminated against in that other land owners were permitted to have caravans on their property.  However, they have failed to show that the local situation in these cases was comparable to their own. The Commission therefore finds no indication of discrimination contrary to Article 14 (Art. 14) of the Convention. It follows that, in this respect, the application is also manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 27 para. 2 (Art. 27-2) of the Convention. 5.      Insofar as the applicants complain of the refusals of planning permission to build a cottage upon their land, the Commission is not required to decide whether or not the facts alleged by the applicants disclose any appearance of a violation of the Convention as, under Article 26 (Art. 26) of the Convention, it may only deal with a matter after all domestic remedies have been exhausted according to the generally recognised rules of international law. In the present case the applicants have failed to appeal against these decisions to the Secretary of State in accordance with S. 36 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1971 and have therefore not exhausted the remedies available to them under United Kingdom law. Moreover, an examination of the case does not disclose the existence of any special circumstances which might have absolved the applicants, according to the generally recognised rules of international law, from exhausting the domestic remedies at their disposal. It follows that, in this respect, the applicants have not complied with the condition as to the exhaustion of domestic remedies and this complaint must be rejected under Article 27 para. 3 (Art. 27-3) of the Convention. For these reasons, the Commission DECLARES THE APPLICATION INADMISSIBLE. Secretary to the Commission        President of the Commission (H.C. KRÜGER)                    (C.A. NØRGAARD)",,

Howard Griffiths and Co., Solicitors, Abertillery, Gwent. The applicant was in dispute with his local education authority over his insistence on educating two of his children at home rather than in state schools.  The local education authority was not satisfied with the standard of education offered at home, particularly in respect of the eldest child. COMPLAINTS The applicant complained that the state of the English law on education and the attitude, decisions and procedures followed by the local education authority were in breach of Articles 1, 5, 6, 8 and 14 of the Convention. PROCEEDINGS BEFORE THE COMMISSION The application was introduced on 18 July 1986 and registered on 3 November 1987. After a preliminary examination of the case by the Rapporteur, the Commission considered the admissibility of the application on 13 July 1987.  It decided to bring the application to the notice of the respondent Government pursuant to Rule 42 para. 2 (b) of its Rules of Procedure, and to invite them to submit written observations on the admissibility and merits of the application. The Government's observations were submitted on 11 December 1987 after an extension of the time-limit for their submission had been granted by the President of the Commission.  In these observations the Government informed the Commission that the applicant and his family had moved in August 1987 and that the children were attending a state primary school in the new area under a different local education authority. The applicant did not reply to these observations and his representatives failed to acknowledge any further correspondence from the Commission's Secretary, including a second letter of reminder sent by registered post on 16 May 1988. REASONS FOR THE DECISION The Commission notes that the applicant and his representatives have not responded to the Government's observations on the admissibility and merits of the case or responded to any further correspondence from the Commission's Secretary.  The Commission finds, therefore, that the applicant has lost interest in his application. It also finds that there are no reasons of a general character affecting the observance of the Convention which necessitate the further examination of this case (Rule 44 para. 1 (b) of the Commission's Rules of Procedure). For these reasons, the Commission DECIDES TO STRIKE THE APPLICATION OFF ITS LIST OF CASES. Secretary to the Commission         President of the Commission (H.C. KRÜGER)                      (C.A.

KRÜGER Secretary to the Commission Having regard to Article 25 (Art. 25) of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms; Having regard to the application introduced on 11 February 1983 by W. against Austria and registered on 28 December 1983 under file No. 10757/84; Having regard to the report provided for in Rule 40 of the Rules of Procedure of the Commission; Having deliberated; Decides as follows: &_THE FACTS&S The applicant, an Austrian citizen born in 1943, resides at D. and is represented by Dr.  W.L. Weh, a lawyer practising in Bregenz. The facts agreed between the parties may be summarised as follows: The applicant had inherited from her mother a half-share of a small farm in M.  The other half-share was owned by her stepfather. None of them lived there or worked on the farm whose land was leased out to other farmers. In October 1980 the applicant's stepfather informed her that he wanted a partition of this real property and would bring a civil action against her if she continued to oppose partition.  The applicant replied that she agreed in principle to a partition, be it by a division of the assets or a division of the sales proceeds. However, she could not agree to the only partition scheme which had so far been submitted by her stepfather as it assigned to her only a fourth of the real value of the farm.  Thereupon the stepfather brought a civil action against the applicant in the Regional Court (Landesgericht) of F. The case was heard on 8 January 1981.  The applicant declared not to oppose her stepfather's claim for a division of the assets. However, she opposed the stepfather's claim to be adjudicated his costs and instead applied for a court order that each party should bear his or her own costs.  She argued that she had not provoked the action as she had never opposed the partition as such, but only the scheme proposed by her stepfather. By a judgment of the same date, the Regional Court decided that the partition should be effected as requested by a division of the assets.  The decision on costs was reserved.  However, the parties subsequently agreed not to pursue the litigation on this point. The parties also agreed to determine the partition scheme by a settlement between themselves.  However, notwithstanding this agreement the applicant's stepfather applied in July 1981 to the District Court (Bezirksgericht) of B. for the partition of the real property concerned in executive proceedings under Section 351 of the Enforcement Proceedings Act (Exekutionsordnung).  At the same time he requested to enforce his cost claim in the amount of AS 6537,44 against the applicant under Section 74 of the same Act.  Both applications were allowed by a decision of the District Court of 5 August 1981. The applicant's appeal against this decision was dismissed by the Regional Court on 11 September 1981.  It stated that both parties were entitled to request enforcement proceedings under Section 351 without a previous attempt to reach a friendly settlement.  The party who first lodged such a request was the petitioner in severance (betreibende Partei) and thus entitled under Section 74 to the reimbursement of his costs from the respondent (verpflichtete Partei). The costs were accordingly imposed on the applicant as the respondent. Subsequently, on 18 June 1982, the District Court, exercising its functions under Section 351, distributed the assets of the joint property between the two parties ordering at the same time that the applicant should pay the sum of AS 20.393,50 as an equalisation payment to her stepfather.  The applicant fully accepted this part of the Court's decision and did not appeal against it. However, the District Court had at the same time ordered under Section 74 that the applicant should reimburse the further costs of the execution proceedings amounting to AS 34.023,52 which had been incurred by her stepfather.  In this respect the applicant appealed, claiming that it was unfair that the party who first applied for enforcement proceedings was granted full compensation for his expenses by the other party although both were essentially in the same position. The Regional Court rejected this appeal by a decision of 28 July 1982 which was served on the applicant on 16 August 1982. The Regional Court noted that Section 351 left it ""to chance or rather to the prompter intervention"" who was the petitioner in severance entitled to costs.  It added: ""Certainly it is an unworthy race to which the parties are compelled by the fact that the one who first presents the application for enforcement to the Court will be the 'winner' regarding the costs.  In many cases this can indeed lead to injustice and unfairness of the worst kind, in particular if the respondent has opposed the action for partition and has lost the case despite this opposition ...  However, it is not for the courts but for the legislation to do away with unsatisfactory legal positions.""  The Court then found that the applicable law left no room for discretion or considerations of equity, and therefore it confirmed the imposition of the costs on the applicant. After the facts of the present case the law was amended in 1983 by introducing a new Section 352 (a) of the Enforcement Proceedings Act, which provides that the cash payments incurred in the course of partition proceedings are to be divided between the parties in relation to their shares in the property. The applicant's stepfather subsequently took further enforcement proceedings against her in order to realise his claims to the equalisation payment and to the reimbursement of his costs resulting from the above partition proceedings.  The District Court of D. granted a request for the attachment of the applicant's movable property, and as no such property could be found, it eventually ordered her to take the oath of manifestation (Offenbarungseid).  The applicant then brought a counteraction (Oppositionsklage) under Section 35 of the Enforcement Proceedings Act, claiming that her stepfather's claims underlying the enforcement proceedings were defective as she had herself certain claims against him resulting from the administration of the joint property which should be set off against his above claims.  She also applied for the suspension of the enforcement proceedings pending the decision on the counteraction, but her remedies in this respect failed and further costs were imposed on her.  However, on 3 February 1983 the parties agreed to stay both the enforcement proceedings and the proceedings on the counteraction pending before the District Court of D.  The applicant thus avoided the oath of manifestation. The applicant's stepfather then requested the correction of the land register in conformity with the partition order.  This was granted by decisions of the District Court of B. of 30 July 1984 and 11 September 1984.  The applicant appealed inter alia on the ground that she had not been heard and claiming that a correction of the land register without her consent infringed Article 6 (Art. 6) of the Convention.  However, her appeal was rejected on 10 October 1984 on the ground that she had not substantiated in which way her rights could have been violated.  The law did not provide for a right to be heard in matters of this kind which were of a merely technical nature. Once the applicant's part of the real property had been ascribed to her in the land register, her stepfather immediately requested a compulsory sales order (Bewilligung der Zwangsver- steigerung) for certain of this property.  This was granted by the District Court of B. on 17 October 1984 and confirmed by the Regional Court on 27 November 1984 despite the applicant's argument that her counteraction was still pending before the District Court of D. and that the compulsory sale should therefore be postponed. She was again charged with the petitioner's procedural expenses. In connection with the compulsory sales procedure the District Court appointed an expert for the purpose of estimating the property's value.  The expert was subsequently replaced by another one against whom the applicant raised objections, but these were rejected by the District Court on the ground that no separate remedy lay against the appointment of an expert.  The applicant appealed, claiming that the exclusion of a remedy in this respect infringed Article 6 (Art. 6) of the Convention.  However, on 27 December 1984 the Regional Court rejected the appeal stating that it was sufficient for securing the parties' right to be heard that they could comment on the expert opinion once it was submitted. On 24 April 1985 the District Court fixed 20 June 1985 as the date of the compulsory sale.  It further ordered that the compulsory sale was to be carried out by three rounds of partial auctions.  The applicant immediately requested a postponement of the compulsory sale until a decision had been given on her counteraction which was still pending.  However, no decision was made on this request and the date of the compulsory sale was publicly announced in the Official Gazette (Amtsblatt) of V. and two regional newspapers.  In this situation the applicant eventually decided on 18 June 1985 to satisfy her stepfather's claims.  On that date she paid a global sum of AS 68,000.- to him.  The parties further agreed that the compulsory sale proceedings should be discontinued and the proceedings on the counteraction stayed (Ruhen).  The compulsory sale proceedings were actually discontinued by a court decision of 18 June 1985. &_COMPLAINTS&S The applicant now complains both of the executive partition proceedings under Section 351 of the Enforcement Proceedings Act, and of the subsequent enforcement proceedings taken against her by her stepfather. 1.      As regards the executive partition proceedings, she claims that they must be considered as proceedings on the determination of civil rights and obligations because they are by their nature not typical enforcement proceedings but rather resemble non-contentious proceedings such as are e.g. applicable to the partition of the property of spouses after a divorce. The applicant considers it unfair that, unlike in other partition proceedings where the parties have to share the costs, they are placed on an unequal footing in the executive partition proceedings under Section 351 of the Enforcement Proceedings Act, and in any subsequent proceedings, including the land register and further enforcement proceedings, by virtue of the distinction between the petitioner and the respondent.  Under Section 74 of the Act the petitioner in severance is entitled to claim the full reimbursement of his costs by the respondent - petitioner being the party who first presents a petition to the court.  The applicant submits that this is not a reasonable criterion to be taken as a basis for cost decisions and that it violates the principle of equality of arms between the parties which is enshrined in Article 6 para. 1 (Art. 6-1) of the Convention. The applicant further complains that the differential treatment of the parties to the partition proceedings in question is discriminatory and contrary to Article 14 (Art. 14) of the Convention. 2.      As regards the subsequent enforcement proceedings, the applicant claims that these proceedings also come within the scope of Article 6 para. 1 (Art. 6-1) of the Convention.  She refers in particular to the connection of these proceedings with the counteraction under Section 35 of the Enforcement Proceedings Act, an action which concerns the justification of the claim underlying these enforcement proceedings. She states that her counter-claims could also have been made the subject of normal civil proceedings, but submits that in the circumstances she could not reasonably be expected to choose that course rather than filing a counteraction. Even if, as a result of the counteraction, the claim of the petitioner should in the end be found to be unjustified having regard to the provisions of substantive law, this does in no way prevent the taking of enforcement measures pending this action, and the costs of the enforcement measures will definitively have to be borne by the respondent.  The applicant considers this to be unfair and contrary to Article 6 para. 1 (Art. 6-1) of the Convention, for the same reasons as in the partition proceedings.  She adds that the refusal to postpone the proceedings pending a decision on the counteraction was extremely unfair in these circumstances:  As regards the enforcement proceedings concerning her movable property the refusal to postpone the proceedings led to serious disadvantages for her, including the order to take the oath of manifestation. As regards the compulsory sale proceedings concerning her real property no decision was taken on her request for postponement, and this despite the fact that the claims of her stepfather might in substance have been unjustified. The applicant further claims that the absence of a remedy to avert the enforcement measures and concomitant costs violates Article 13 (Art. 13) of the Convention.  She finally claims that there is an unjustified interference with her property rights contrary to Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (P1-1). The applicant considers that she is not prevented from raising these complaints by the settlement which she concluded with her stepfather on 18 June 1985.  She submits that this settlement was made under duress as she was compelled to renounce her counter-claims and costs in the amount of some AS 200,000.-. &_PROCEEDINGS&S The application was introduced on 11 February 1983 and registered on 28 December 1983. On 4 May 1987 the Commission decided to give notice of the application to the respondent Government and to invite them, in accordance with Rule 42 para. 2 (b) of the Rules of Procedure, to submit before 17 July 1987 their observations in writing on the admissibility and merits of the application.  Questions were put to the Government concerning the applicant's complaint of the partition proceedings under Section 351 of the Enforcement Proceedings Act. The Government submitted their observations on 20 July 1987. The applicant submitted her observations in reply on 3 October 1987. On 18 December 1987 the Commission decided to grant the applicant free legal aid. &_SUBMISSIONS OF THE PARTIES&S A.      The Government In the Government's view, Article 6 para. 1 (Art. 6-1) of the Convention is not applicable to partition proceedings as provided under Section 351 of the Enforcement Proceedings Act. Proceedings for the legal partition of a property can be instituted by means of an action by a co-owner against the other co-owner or co-owners.  The pertinent legal provisions are contained in Sections 841 to 853 of the Civil Code.  Such proceedings end with a judgment terminating the co-ownership and determining, at the same time, the type of partition, i.e. either actual partition (Realteilung) or sales order (Zivilteilung).  The particularity of such a judgment is that its enforcement can be requested by both parties.  The party who files the request first assumes the part of the petitioner in severance in the enforcement proceedings. Another particularity of such a partition judgment is that, while it must clearly specify what is to be partitioned and whether there is to be an actual partition or a sales order, it need not necessarily contain details on how exactly the actual partition is to be carried out, which would be binding upon the court competent for enforcement matters.  This decision may also be taken by the judge of the latter court. Under Section 351 para. 1 of the Enforcement Proceedings Act the partition is to be effected by a legal officer of the court competent for enforcement matters, with all parties concerned participating, paying due consideration to Sections 841 to 853 of the Civil Code.  The judge fixes a date for the hearing and, after having finished the necessary inquiries, issues the partition order in compliance with the requirements of appropriateness and equity. Up to the judgment terminating the co-ownership and thus defining the rights of the parties, the procedure is of a contentious nature leading to a judgment.  Subsequent executive proceedings, if any, only serve to enforce this judgment.  The enforcement character of the proceedings is confirmed by the consideration that, contrary to subsequent Section 352, Section 351 of the Enforcement Proceedings Act only refers to Sections 841 to 853 of the Civil Code and not to the stipulations governing non-contentious proceedings.  Another indication that these proceedings are exclusively enforcement proceedings is the fact that the judge is not bound by requests or proposals for partition made by the parties, but has to proceed according to his own discretion and the principles of appropriateness and equity.  In contentious proceedings such conduct by the judge would be inadmissible. In Application No. 9233/81 (Dec. 15.10.81) the Commission stated that Article 6 (Art. 6) of the Convention is not applicable to enforcement proceedings.  The decisive factor for the Commission was that the issue of enforcement proceedings is no longer a contestation and hence an immediate determination of civil rights and obligations.  The contestation on civil rights and obligations takes place in the contentious proceedings preceding the enforcement proceedings.  Although in the present case the judgment ruled on the actual partition only in general terms and left it to the judge competent for the enforcement proceedings to decide upon the actual partition, the litigation concerning the partition as such, and thus on the civil rights of the parties, took place in the proceedings leading to the partition judgment.  Section 351 starts out from the fact that the partition judgment constitutes an enforceable fiat of execution (vollstreckbarer Exekutionstitel).  At this stage the judge only has ""to enforce the actual partition ordered"".  Therefore, it cannot be said that the proceedings under Section 351 are proceedings concerning a contestation on the partition of a joint property and consequently a contestation on civil rights and obligations. The Government further submit that the applicant failed to exhaust all domestic remedies available to her. Under Article 89 of the Federal Constitution, a court of second instance must ex officio file an application with the Constitutional Court for review of the law if it has doubts as to the constitutionality of this law.  An individual is entitled to challenge the constitutionality of a law under Article 140 para. 1 of the Constitution only if the law has become operative for the applicant without the delivery of a judicial or administrative decision.  As in the present case there was a judicial decision, the applicant could claim unconstitutionality of applied regulations only by suggesting to the court of second instance that it should make an application to the Constitutional Court under Article 89 of the Constitution.  The Government submit that Article 26 (Art. 26) of the Convention requires in this context that doubts as to the conformity of an applicable law with the Convention be voiced in the domestic proceedings with sufficient precision.  The applicant, in her appeal of 2 July 1982, failed to sufficiently elaborate on her concerns about the constitutionality of the law.  It would have been possible and even required to specify, in particular, the concern about the incompatibility of Section 351 of the Enforcement Proceedings Act with Article 6 (Art. 6) of the Convention.  The court would then have been obliged to take a clear stand and to state explicitly why it had no scruples against the application of this provision.  Although the competent court admittedly considered that the law provided only an unsatisfactory solution, its attention was not specifically drawn to a possible problem under Article 6 (Art. 6) of the Convention.  Accordingly, it cannot be said that all domestic remedies were exhausted. Finally, the Government submit that the principle of fair trial relates to the proceedings before civil and criminal courts. An essential element of fair trial is the principle of equality of arms which also applies to civil proceedings.  But this principle only aims at ensuring the same procedural positions to the parties.  A regulation of and the concrete decision on the reimbursement of costs, however, neither relates to the procedural position nor the proceedings as such.  For this reason the regulation of who has to pay the costs as well as the actual decision on the costs cannot violate Article 6 (Art. 6) of the Convention. Insofar as there might be doubts about the equality before the law, the applicant's allegation could perhaps have had a chance of success before the Constitutional Court on the basis of Article 7 of the Federal Constitution.  However, under Article 14 (Art. 14) of the Convention inequality cannot be alleged save in connection with the rights enshrined in the Convention.  As the regulation and decision on the payment of costs does not relate to a procedural position safeguarded by the fair trial principle, and as it affects no other right laid down in the Convention, which could be tied to Article 14 (Art. 14) of the Convention, this allegation must be rejected as inadmissible too. The interests of the parties following a partition judgment may vary greatly.  The lawmaker can be guided by the normal case, which will be that one co-owner wants to enforce the partition against the opposing co-owners.  Under this aspect, it seems to lie within the discretion of the lawmaker to have the cost regulation of enforcement proceedings apply.  It may be correct that the provision based on the criterion that costs shall be adjudicated to the party which first makes a request for the enforcement of the partition judgment is not a very lucky legal solution.  However, it is not possible in this context to raise objections against the present cost decision and the underlying legal regulation other than in terms of considerations of legal appropriateness and concepts of justice.  In this connection the Government observe that the Enforcement Proceedings Act was amended in 1983 (cf. p. 3 above). The Government therefore ask the Commission to dismiss the application on the ground that not all domestic remedies were exhausted, or alternatively to declare it inadmissible as being manifestly ill-founded. B.      The Applicant The applicant submits that the Government's argumentation concerning the nature of partition proceedings under Section 351 of the Enforcement Proceedings Act is exclusively based on the domestic law.  It overlooks that the notion of ""civil rights"" within the meaning of Article 6 (Art. 6) of the Convention is an autonomous concept (cf. Eur.  Court H.R., Ringeisen judgment of 16 July 1971, Series A no. 13, p.39 para. 94).  It thus cannot be decisive that in the internal legal system the partition proceedings in question are regarded as enforcement proceedings. Even if they were enforcement proceedings, they would not be excluded from the scope of Article 6 (Art. 6) as the Commission has held in an analogous case (No. 2797/66, Dec. ....). The applicant considers that, in reality, the partition proceedings are not enforcement proceedings in the proper sense even in the domestic law.  The Government's submissions in this respect are misleading in several respects.  Under the provisions of the Civil Code each co-owner can ask for the termination of the co-ownership by bringing an action against the other co-owner or co-owners.  However, such a claim is excluded if it is being raised at an inappropriate time or under circumstances which involve a disadvantage for the other co-owners.  The court accordingly has to examine only these two questions, whether the claim has been raised at an inappropriate moment or under circumstances which involve a disadvantage for the other co-owners.  If such circumstances cannot be established, the court is obliged to order the termination of the co-ownership.  If at all possible from an economic point of view, it must order the actual partition of the property.  Only if that should be impossible may it order the sale of the property by auction, in which case all co-owners have the right to bid.  In the contentious proceedings the court therefore only examines which form of partition is appropriate and whether the above legal obstacles against the partition order exist. All further particulars of the actual partition are reserved to the judge competent for enforcement matters.  The judge dealing with a case in contentious proceedings must, in principle, refrain from deciding on the particulars of the actual partition. Accordingly the proceedings before the courts competent in enforcement matters do not serve exclusively ""to enforce the actual partition ordered"".  The judge competent in enforcement matters determines which part of the property shall be assigned to each co-owner as his sole property.  He thus determines the future distribution of the property and does not only enforce clearly defined civil claims resulting from the earlier decision.  This is confirmed by the fact that Section 351 of the Enforcement Proceedings Act, as the only provision of this Act, refers to the substantive law contained in the Civil Code.  It thus makes it clear that the proceedings still concern the determination of civil rights, namely the civil rights of the co-owners according to the provisions of the Civil Code. The fact that the actual partition is left to the judge competent in enforcement matters is explained by the consideration that there may be more than two co-owners.  In this case the party claiming termination of the co-ownership must lodge a joint action against all other co-owners.  If the conditions of actual partition are not met in the case of only one co-owner the action must be rejected, but if it is allowed it is impossible in contentious proceedings to distribute the property between more than two parties. Contentious proceedings between more than two parties do not exist under the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure.  It is primarily for this reason that the actual partition has been left to the judge competent in enforcement matters.  Apart from this reason based on systematical considerations there are a number of more practical reasons why the court competent in enforcement matters has been entrusted with the task of actual partition.  The competent court here is the District Court which as a rule is located closer to the property and has more experience regarding the assessment of real property.  But this does not mean that, in substance, the actual partition by the court competent in enforcement matters does not involve a determination of civil rights.  The applicant further observes in this context that it has been recognised in the case-law that the redistribution of real property, e.g. in the context of agricultural land consolidation proceedings, is a determination of civil rights (cf.  Eur.  Court H.R., Erkner and Hofauer judgment of 23 April 1987, Series A no. 117). In the present case both parties requested the adjudication of the farmhouse and the surrounding parcels and the judge competent in enforcement matters who decided on the actual partition upheld the applicant's claim in this respect.  This clearly shows that the matter was one of the determination of the applicant's civil rights and obligations to which Article 6 (Art. 6) is applicable. As regards the Government's argument that the applicant has not exhausted the domestic remedies, the applicant observes that this question must be judged in the light of the prospects of success of the remedy in question on the basis of the existing case-law.  It would be inappropriate in this context to adopt a too formalistic approach because this would be incompatible with a system of effective protection of human rights. While admitting that the applicant could not herself have asked for a review of the constitutionality of the applicable legislation by the Constitutional Court, the Government claim that the applicant should have suggested to the Regional Court of F. to request such constitutional review under Article 89 para. 2 of the Federal Constitution.  However, as regards such a request by a court of second instance the principle ""jura novit curia"" must be applied. This has been confirmed by the case-law of the Supreme Court.  In a decision of 2 July 1986 it expressly confirmed that an individual party has no right under the applicable legislation to request a measure under Article 89 para. 2 of the Federal Constitution (""eine Verfahrenspartei ist nach der geltenden Rechtslage nicht befugt, ein Vorgehen gemäss Artikel 89 Abs. 2 B-VG zu begehren"").  A request for the constitutional review of applicable legislation is therefore inadmissible in civil proceedings.  There is no right to obtain a decision following such a request and the Commission has accordingly recognised that it is not a remedy to be exhausted under Article 26 (Art. 26) of the Convention (cf.  No. 10522/83, 11011/84 and 11070/84, Mellacher and others v.  Austria, Dec. 8.5.86).  This is also in line with the Commission's case-law concerning other similar remedies which give no right to obtain a decision such as, for instance, a suggestion to the Attorney General to file a plea of nullity for safeguarding the law. The applicant furthermore submits that in the present case the suggestion to seek a constitutional review would not have had any prospects of success in view of the attitude of the Regional Court of F. at the relevant time, that is in Summer 1982.  That Court had never requested a constitutional review of any legislation applied by it and had never applied Article 6 (Art. 6) of the Convention as a directly applicable norm.  Moreover, the Regional Court was not compelled by the legislation to take the decision which it actually took.  The decision of the Regional Court of Innsbruck of 23 January 1970 (2R369/69), to which the applicant had referred in her appeal, shows that the law could have been interpreted differently. If it was possible to interpret the law in question in conformity with the Constitution, it was excluded that the Constitutional Court would quash that law as unconstitutional. As regards the question whether the applicant was required to expressly invoke Article 6 (Art. 6) of the Convention in her appeal, she observes that this again is a question where the principle ""jura novit curia"" must apply.  She claims that, in substance, her appeal fully addressed the relevant problem of the unfairness of the decision on the costs, including the question of equality of arms in the proceedings and equality before the law in general.  It is clear that the Regional Court understood these arguments as in its subsequent decision it spoke itself of an ""unworthy race"" to the court and of ""injustice and unfairness of the worst kind"".  The Commission has constantly held that questions relating to the exhaustion of remedies must be assessed without undue formalism and that the only relevant criterion is whether the applicant has brought the substance of this complaint before the domestic authorities (cf.  No. 9783/82, Dec. 8.5.85).  In these circumstances it must have been sufficient for the applicant, without specifically referring to Article 6 (Art. 6) of the Convention, to invoke a decision by the Regional Court of I. which showed that an interpretation of the law in question in conformity with the Convention was, in fact, possible. The applicant therefore maintains that, by bringing the substance of her complaint before the competent domestic court, she has in fact exhausted the domestic remedies in conformity with Article 26 (Art. 26) of the Convention. As regards the substance of her complaint, the applicant observes that the Government themselves have doubts that the decision complained of was in line with the principle of equality.  In the applicant's view civil proceedings conducted contrary to the principle of equality must be regarded as unfair.  Moreover, the subsequent legislative amendment also shows that the applicant's complaint was, in substance, justified.  The applicant admits that there are various ways of regulating the costs of civil proceedings.  However, the legislation in this respect must not be based on arbitrary criteria.  In the applicant's submission it is wholly arbitrary to assign different roles to the parties to partition proceedings exclusively on the basis of the criterion of who has won the ""unworthy race"" to the court. The Government's further argument, that a regulation of and the concrete decision on the reimbursement of costs neither relates to the procedural position of the parties nor to the proceedings as such, has been put forward without any reference to the case-law of the Convention organs.  The latter have repeatedly recognised that both in civil and criminal proceedings questions of costs may be of decisive importance (cf.  Eur.  Court H.R., Airey judgment of 9 October 1979, Series A no. 32, and Luedicke, Belkacem and Koc judgment of 28 November 1978, Series A no. 29).  Also Austrian legal writers consider questions of costs as an essential element of a fair trial and this has recently been confirmed by decisions of the Supreme Court (EuGRZ 1987, p. 83) and the Regional Court of Feldkirch (EuGRZ 1986, p. 692) although - significantly - no reference was made in this context to Article 6 (Art. 6) of the Convention. The applicant stresses that in proceedings which concern economic interests questions of costs are of great importance.  In the present case the costs of each party, only for the inspection of the site at M. amounted to some AS 25,OOO.  Where such sums are involved it is unavoidable that the possible duty to bear the relevant costs will influence the procedural behaviour of the parties, in particular if they are in a weak financial position as the present applicant.  A regulation of the costs based on reasonable criteria is therefore intimately linked to the requirements of a fair trial and comes within the scope of Article 6 (Art. 6) of the Convention.  The proceedings must be regarded as a whole and it is inadmissible to exclude certain aspects such as questions of cost from the overall assessment of the fairness. The arbitrary imposition of all costs on the applicant in the present case therefore amounted in her view to a violation of her rights under Article 6 (Art. 6) of the Convention, having regard, in particular, to the finding of the competent domestic court that the regulation on the reimbursement of costs had led to an ""unfairness of the worst kind"" in this case. Apart from her replies to the Government's observations, the applicant insists that the other aspects of her case relating to the subsequent enforcement proceedings also raise serious issues under Article 6 (Art. 6) of the Convention.  In particular, she submits that the Court's refusal to give suspensive effect to her counteraction was extremely unfair.  The claims raised in this counteraction had been well substantiated and nevertheless the courts did not stop the enforcement measures taken against her by the opposite party, ordered her to take the oath of manifestation and did not take a decision until two days before the date fixed for the compulsory sale of her property.  By this way of proceeding the applicant was forced to give up the greater part of her justified claims and consent to a compromise solution which was extremely unfavourable to her. The applicant therefore fully maintains her application. &_THE LAW&S 1.      The applicant first complains of partition proceedings under Section 351 of the Enforcement Proceedings Act claiming that these proceedings were unfair and contrary to Article 6 para. 1 (Art. 6-1) of the Convention because of the unilateral imposition of all costs on her as respondent although she was in essentially the same position as the petitioner. Article 6 para. 1 (Art. 6-1), first sentence of the Convention provides: ""In the determination of his civil rights and obligations or of any criminal charge against him, everyone is entitled to a fair and public hearing within a reasonable time by an independent and impartial tribunal established by law."" The Commission first observes that, as a general rule, enforcement proceedings following a civil court judgment do not come within the scope of Article 6 para. 1 (Art. 6-1) of the Convention. They do not themselves determine a dispute (""contestation"") relating to civil rights, but presuppose a prior determination of these rights by the competent court.  However, partition proceedings under Section 351 of the Austrian Enforcement Proceedings Act differ from normal enforcement proceedings. In the Ringeisen judgment of 16 July 1971 (Eur.  Court H.R., Series A no. 13, p. 39 para. 94) the European Court of Human Rights has stated that Article 6 para. 1 (Art. 6-1) ""covers all proceedings the result of which is decisive for private rights and obligations ... The character of the legislation which governs how the matter is to be determined ... [is] of little consequence"".  Accordingly, it cannot be decisive that in the Austrian legal system the partition proceedings in question are considered as enforcement proceedings and are governed by the Enforcement Proceedings Act.  It has been recognised in earlier case-law that proceedings relating to the division or redistribution of real property between several parties, in particular where they concern the designation of the concrete assets to be assigned to each of those parties as their future property, involve a determination of civil rights within the meaning of Article 6 para. 1 (Art. 6-1) of the Convention (cf. mutatis mutandis No. 8695/79, Inze v.  Austria, Dec. 5.12.84, para. 7 of ""The Law"";  Eur.  Court H.R., judgments of 23 April 1987 in the cases of Ettl, Erkner/Hofauer and Poiss, Series A no. 117).  Also the proceedings at issue in the present case determined the particular assets of the parties' former joint property which were to be assigned to each of them as their future sole property.  They thus involved a decision on the civil rights of the parties including the applicant. It follows that Article 6 para. 1 (Art. 6-1) of the Convention is applicable to these proceedings. The Government claim that the applicant failed to exhaust all domestic remedies, as required by Article 26 (Art. 26) of the Convention, because she did not specifically suggest to the Regional Court that it should initiate a constitutional review of the applicable provisions of the Enforcement Proceedings Act under Article 6 (Art. 6) of the Convention. The Commission notes that the applicant herself could not seize the Constitutional Court with this question and that she had no enforceable right to have it brought before the Constitutional Court by the Regional Court.  In these circumstances the possibility of suggesting the initiation of constitutional review cannot be regarded as an effective remedy to be exhausted under Article 26 (Art. 26) of the Convention (cf.  No. 7464/76, Karrer, Fuchs and Kodrnja v. Austria, Dec. 5.12.78, D.R. 14 p. 51; Nos. 10522/83, 11011/84 and 11070/84, Mellacher and others v.  Austria, Dec. 8.5.86, to be published in D.R.). There remains the question whether the applicant failed to comply with Article 26 (Art. 26) because in her appeal to the Regional Court she did not expressly refer to Article 6 (Art. 6) of the Convention.  However, the Commission has consistently held that domestic remedies must be considered as having been exhausted if the applicant, even without quoting the relevant provision of the Convention, has submitted, in substance, to the competent domestic authorities the claim he or she is bringing before the Commission, in particular when the domestic authorities apply the principle ""jura novit curia"" (cf. e.g. No. 9228/80, Dec. 16.12.82, D.R. 30 p. 132). In the present case the applicant clearly alleged an unfairness of the proceedings on account of the one-sided cost decision and therefore put the substance of her complaint before the competent domestic court.  Her complaint therefore cannot be rejected for failure to exhaust the domestic remedies as required by Article 26 (Art. 26) of the Convention. The applicant claims that the question of costs cannot be separated from the proceedings as a whole and that in the present case the one-sided imposition of all costs on her as respondent, although she was in essentially the same position as the petitioner, was arbitrary and made the proceedings unfair.  The Government object that the question of costs did not affect the parties' procedural position or the conduct of the proceedings as such.  They claim that, for this reason, the applicant's complaint falls outside the scope of Article 6 para. 1 (Art. 6-1) and is manifestly ill-founded. The Commission recalls the case-law according to which in civil cases high costs of proceedings may, in certain circumstances, raise an issue under Article 6 para. 1 (Art. 6-1) of the Convention which secures to everyone a right of access to the courts and the right to a fair trial (cf.  Eur.  Court H.R., Airey judgment of 9 October 1979, Series A no. 32; No. 6202/73, Dec. 16.3.75, D.R. 1 p. 66; No. 7973/77, Dec. 28.2.79, D.R. 17 p. 74; No. 9353/81, Webb v. UK, Dec. 11.5.83, D.R. 33 p. 133).  The Commission notes that in the present case the courts applied regulations on the reimbursement of costs which, in the opinion of the competent court of second instance, could lead to highly unfair results in certain cases.  The Commission further notes that the relevant cost regulations were subsequently amended, apparently on the basis of similar considerations. However, the Commission considers that under Article 6 para. 1 (Art. 6-1) of the Convention it cannot consider the fairness of cost regulations as such, but only whether the application of such regulations made the proceedings unfair insofar as the determination of civil rights and obligations is concerned.  This would be so e.g. where prohibitive costs and the refusal to grant legal aid prevented effective access to the court for securing a legitimate civil law claim (cf. the above-mentioned cases of Airey and Webb), or where the imposition of certain costs was likely to influence a party's procedural behaviour e.g. by making him or her refrain from raising relevant arguments or legitimate claims.  Nothing of the kind happened in the present case. The applicant's access to court was not interfered with, she could submit all relevant arguments and thereby secure a decision on the merits of her case which essentially corresponded to her own wishes. The cost decision was taken simultaneously with this decision on the merits and, although it might have been foreseeable on the basis of the applicable legislation, nevertheless did not influence her procedural behaviour.  There is consequently no appearance of a violation of the requirements of a fair hearing within the meaning of Article 6 para. 1 (Art. 6-1) of the Convention, and the complaint in this respect must accordingly be rejected under Article 27 para. 2 (Art. 27-2) of the Convention as being manifestly ill-founded. 2.      The applicant further complains that the one-sided imposition of all costs on her was discriminatory and thus contrary to Article 14 (Art. 14) of the Convention, read in conjunction with Article 6 para. 1 (Art. 6-1).  The Commission, having found the latter provision to be applicable to the case, finds that Article 14 (Art. 14) is also applicable. However, the different treatment of the applicant as compared to that of the opposite party with regard to the obligation to pay the costs in question was only the consequence of her being the defendant in the case.  It thus was not based on any particular personal status of the kind mentioned in Article 14 (Art. 14).  If the applicant had been the petitioner in severance she could have claimed reimbursement of her costs from the opposite party in the same way as the latter did in the present case.  The applicant's complaint under Article 14 (Art. 14) of the Convention must therefore also be rejected as being manifestly ill-founded. 3.      The applicant further complains of the subsequent enforcement proceedings taken against her by her stepfather for the recovery of his equalisation and cost claims resulting from the above partition proceedings.  The applicant submits that these proceedings also come within the scope of Article 6 para. 1 (Art. 6-1) of the Convention because of the connection with her counteraction under Section 35 of the Enforcement Proceedings Act by which she tried to contest the underlying claims. She claims that Article 6 para. 1 (Art. 6-1) of the Convention was violated by the unfairness of the Court's refusal to postpone the enforcement proceedings pending the decision on her counteraction, and also because of the imposition of all the costs on her despite this counteraction.  She further alleges violations of Article 13 (Art. 13) of the Convention and of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (P1-1)in this respect. However, the Commission notes that both in the enforcement proceedings concerning the applicant's movable property and in the subsequent compulsory sale proceedings concerning her real property she reached a settlement with her stepfather whose claims she eventually satisfied.  The applicant states that she accepted the first settlement of 3 February 1983 in order to avoid the oath of manifestation, and the second settlement of 18 June 1985 under the threat of losing her real property by its compulsory sale. However, there is no indication that these circumstances affected the validity of the settlements under Austrian law, or that these settlements were a necessary consequence of the underlying legislation which left the applicant no chance to reach a more favourable solution of her case (cf.  No. 8695/79, Inze v.  Austria, Dec. 5.12.1984, para. 2 of The Law, to be published in D.R.).  In particular the applicant was in no way compelled by the law to renounce the compensation claims which she believed to have against her stepfather and which were at the basis of her counteraction.  If she had not agreed to refrain from pursuing her counter-claims the Courts would have been obliged to determine their justification either on the basis of Section 35 of the Enforcement Proceedings Act, or in the framework of normal civil proceedings.  The applicant would also 10757/84 have had the possibility of taking further compensation proceedings against her stepfather for any damage caused to her by the taking of premature enforcement proceedings, or even of bringing an official liability action against the competent courts if they had failed to determine her counteraction within reasonable time and thereby caused damage to the applicant. In these circumstances the Commission finds no basis for the applicant's complaints under the Convention regarding the proceedings which eventually led to the conclusion of the above settlements.  The applicant is bound by the terms of these settlements and can no longer claim to be a victim, within the meaning of Article 25 (Art. 25) of the Convention, of a violation of her Convention rights in these proceedings or as a consequence thereof (cf. mutadis mutandis, No. 8865/80, Dec. 10.7.81, D.R. 25 p. 252).  It follows that the applicant's complaints in this respect must be rejected as being manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 27 para. 2 (Art. 27-2) of the Convention.

KRÜGER Secretary to the Commission Having regard to Article 25 (Art. 25) of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms; Having regard to the application introduced on 10 June 1986 by Sture STIGSON against Sweden and registered on 2 July 1986 under file No. 12264/86; Having regard to the report provided for in Rule 40 of the Rules of Procedure of the Commission; Having deliberated; Decides as follows: THE FACTS The facts of the case, as submitted by the applicant, may be summarised as follows. The applicant is a Swedish citizen, born in 1918.  He is the retired director of the Swedish National Board for Technical Development.  He resides at Lidingö, Sweden. The applicant served in the Swedish army in the years 1938 to 1941.  In 1942 he entered the Royal Värmland's Regiment as a reserve officer and his remuneration when on active duty and also after having fulfilled his duties as a reserve officer was set out in the Swedish Royal Ordinance no. 364 of 1927.  Section 29 of the Ordinance reads as follows: ""Early retired officers and officers appointed in the reserve corps, civil military (civilmilitär) persons of a comparative position and non-commissioned officers (underofficer) who have, in an appropriate manner, fulfilled the prescribed service or who have, as a result of injury or illness inflicted during service, been unable to fulfil the said service, are awarded an annual pension after having reached the age of 55, totalling 900 Swedish crowns for an officer (or equal) and for a non-commissioned officer totalling 672 Swedish crowns.  However, those who have been appointed in the reserve officers' corps are, after the age of 42, under the conditions indicated, entitled to receive, instead of the pension, an amount corresponding to 5 % of the capitalised value of the pension."" In 1961 the applicant was informed by the National Pension Board (Statens pensionsanstalt) that he had fulfilled his duties according to the 1927 Ordinance and that he was entitled to either the pension or the capitalised sum.  The applicant chose the pension system which meant that he would receive a monthly sum as from the year in which he reached the age of 55, which would be in 1973. Following the introduction in 1960 of the general additional pension (ATP) it was decided by the Swedish Royal Ordinance 1962:661 that the reserve officers pension should be co-ordinated with the new additional pension in accordance with the Social Insurance Act (lagen om allmän försäkring). On 13 November 1973, the year in which the applicant reached the age of 55, the applicant received from the appropriate defence authority a letter whereby he was informed that he was now entitled to receive the pension in accordance with the 1927 Ordinance.  He was furthermore informed that the pension now amounted to 405 Swedish crowns per month.  The applicant received the pension as from 6 December 1973 and by the time he reached the age of 65, in December 1983, the amount had reached 1,011 Swedish crowns per month due to a specific index regulation. It appears that the applicant retired in 1983 and on retirement he was entitled to an old age pension as well as the general additional pension (ATP).  The latter had, as mentioned above, been introduced in 1960 and furthermore, by Royal Ordinance no. 661 of 1962, it had been decided to co-ordinate the reserve officers pension and the ATP pension.  The applicant realised that upon retirement and upon receiving the ATP pension his reserve officers pension was reduced as from December 1983.  He therefore complained to the National Salaries and Pensions Board (Statens löne- och pensionsverk) which rejected his complaints on 17 February 1984.  In its decision the National Salaries and Pensions Board stated as follows: ""As from 6 December 1973 you received a reserve officers pension in accordance with the Ordinance 1927:364 regarding officers and civil military personnel in the army's reserves. In accordance with the Royal Ordinance 1962:661 (as amended through Royal Ordinance 1970:509 and Ordinance 1977:9) the reserve officers pension shall be reduced in view of (co-ordinated with) the general additional pension (ATP) in accordance with the Social Insurance Act. It follows from the provisions that the reserve officers pension must be reduced by 10 % of the ATP.  In your case you will receive 1,011 - 659 (10% of ATP) = 352 crowns. As the co-ordination is carried out in accordance with the applicable provisions the National Salaries and Pensions Board has no intention to change its decision that the reserve officers pension and the general additional pension should be co-ordinated as indicated above."" Realising that his reserve officers pension had been reduced by approximately two-thirds the applicant complained about this decision to the Administrative Court of Appeal (kammarrätten). Referring to the factual circumstances of the case the applicant pointed out that the contract between him and the State and the latter's obligation to pay in accordance with the 1927 Ordinance had come into effect in 1961, which was before the act on co-ordination of pensions had entered into force.  He maintained therefore that the law could not apply retroactively to his situation.  Furthermore, he maintained that his so-called reserve officers pension was no pension but merely a part of a contract and should not therefore be co-ordinated with the ATP pension.  Accordingly he requested the Court of Appeal to overrule the decision of the National Salaries and Pensions Board and to award him his full reserve officers pension. In its judgment of 19 December 1984 the Administrative Court of Appeal stated as follows: ""The Administrative Court of Appeal, which notes that the Ordinance 1962:661 entered into force on 1 January 1963 and contains provisions concerning co-ordination of the reserve officers pension and the ATP as from this day onwards, does not change the decision complained of."" The applicant complained to the Supreme Administrative Court (regeringsrätten) maintaining in substance the position taken before the Administrative Court of Appeal.  On 30 December 1985, however, the Supreme Administrative Court refused to grant leave to appeal. COMPLAINTS The applicant invokes Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (P1-1) to the Convention.  He maintains that by co-ordinating the reserve officers pension and the ATP, and thereby reducing his reserve officers pension he has been deprived of his possessions by the respondent Government without this being in the public interest or for tax purposes.  He maintains that the so-called reserve officers pension is not at all a pension but a clear remuneration and part of the contract which he entered into with the Government when he became a reserve officer.  In any event he maintains that the introduction of co-ordination of pensions in 1963 could not apply to him since his entitlements entered into force already in 1961. THE LAW The applicant has complained that he has been deprived of his possessions contrary to Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (P1-1) to the Convention when his reserve officers pension was co-ordinated with the ATP, thereby reducing the amount he received from the former. Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (P1-1) to the Convention provides that any person is entitled to peaceful enjoyment of his possessions and that no one shall be deprived of his possessions except in the public interest and subject to conditions provided for by law and by the general principles of international law. According to the Commission's constant case-law the right to a pension is not as such guaranteed by the Convention (cf. for example Müller v.  Austria, Comm.  Report 1.10.75, para. 27, D.R. 3 p. 25, and No. 7624/76, Dec. 6.7.77, D.R. 19 p. 100).  However, the Commission has considered that the right to a pension which is based on employment can in certain circumstances be assimilated to a property right.  This may be the case where special contributions have been paid or the employer, as in the present case, has given a more general undertaking to pay a pension on conditions which can be considered to be part of the employment contract (cf.  No. 10671/83, Dec. 4.3.85, unpublished). For the purposes of the present case, and having regard to the relevant provision of the Swedish Royal Ordinance of 1927, the Commission would not exclude that the applicant, when entering the Royal Värmland's Regiment as a reserve officer and after fulfilling the requirements of Section 29 of the Ordinance, acquired a property right within the meaning of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (P1-1) to the Convention. In the present case the Commission recalls, however, that the applicant's right to benefit from the acquired right under the Royal Ordinance of 1927 is left intact and it is merely the amount in question which has been reduced.  This reduction is solely due to the fact that the applicant, after reaching a certain age, became entitled to both ATP and old age pensions and since the Swedish Parliament had introduced legislation which should co-ordinate the benefits received through the various pension schemes available in Sweden. It follows from the above that the applicant in essence asks for full benefits from all the pension schemes applicable to him.  The Commission does not find, however, that the authorities, when applying the legal provisions concerning co-ordination of the pension schemes, can be considered to have deprived the applicant of a property right which he previously had.  If the applicant's submissions were to be accepted, he should, under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (P1-1), be entitled to full benefits for his service as a reserve officer irrespective of the benefits that could be derived from other pension systems.  The Commission considers, however, that it cannot be in conflict with Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (P1-1) to the Convention that a co-ordination is made between different pension systems. Accordingly, having regard to the above considerations, the Commission finds that there is no appearance of a violation of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (P1-1) to the Convention, or of any other Article of the Convention. It follows that the application is manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 27 para. 2 (Art. 27-2) of the Convention.

KRÜGER, Secretary to the Commission Having regard to Article 25 (Art. 25) of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms; Having regard to the application introduced on 5 July 1985 by Thomas CAMPBELL against the United Kingdom and registered on 8 August 1986 under file No. 12323/86; Having regard to: -  the report provided for by Rule 40 of the Rules of Procedure of the Commission; -  the Government's observations of 2 June 1987; -  the applicant's observations of 6 August 1987; - ii - -  the second report provided for by Rule 40 of the Rules of Procedure; -  the submissions of the parties at the hearing on 13 July 1988; Having deliberated; Decides as follows: THE FACTS The applicant is a British citizen born in 1952 and resident in Glasgow.  He is currently serving a life sentence.  He is represented before the Commission by John Carroll, a solicitor.  The facts as agreed by the parties may be summarised as follows. On 16 April 1984, a fire occurred in a house in Glasgow in which six persons died.  This was an incident in a spate of violence and vandalism occurring between rivals in the ice-cream trade. The applicant, who had relations in the ice-cream trade and a record of violent offences was arrested and appeared in Court on 16 May 1984 charged with conspiracy.  On 22 May, the applicant was brought back to Court and served with a fresh petition charging murder in respect of the fire on 16 April 1984.  During the judicial examination of the applicant, the Procurator Fiscal Depute conducting the case, questioned him on the basis that the applicant was present at the house and was involved in starting the fire.  The applicant in reply specified in detail an alibi for that time. The applicant was subsequently indicted to the High Court in Glasgow on charges of conspiracy to commit robbery, wilful fire-raising, murder, assault and instigation of others to commit assault and murder.  The applicant was found guilty of assault and murder on 10 October 1984 and was sentenced to ten years imprisonment and life imprisonment, with a recommendation that he serve not less than twenty years. The applicant applied for legal aid to appeal his conviction: he had already been legally-aided during the trial.  It appears however that the applicant's counsel indicated that they would not be prepared to argue his appeal as he wished.  The applicant therefore prepared and lodged his own grounds of appeal and with the aid of a solicitor, prepared his submissions on appeal, copies of which were provided for the Appeal Court judges.  The applicant applied under Section 274 of the Criminal Procedure (Scotland) 1975 Act to have the shorthand notes of the trial but this request was refused both by the Clerk of the Justiciary and the Secretary of State. The applicant presented his appeal on 16 and 17 June 1985 and was kept in manacles throughout the proceedings.  The applicant requested the Lord Justice Clerk to have the manacles removed so that he could reach and refer to his papers but this request was denied and the applicant was kept handcuffed to one prison officer while before the Court.  The prosecution was represented by a senior Advocate Depute, a Q.C., who was assisted by junior counsel and members of the Procurator Fiscal service.  On page 2 of the Court's Opinion the Lord Justice Clerk states: ""When he was called upon to make his submissions in support of his grounds of appeal the appellant stated that they were all included in the said summary and asked the Court's leave simply to read that document to the Court.  Such leave was granted and he read the document to the Court. When he had done so he was asked if he wished to add anything to what he had already submitted and he replied in the negative.  The learned Advocate Depute replied, and the appellant then sought leave to answer some of the points made by the Advocate Depute.  Although this further speech is contrary to normal procedure in criminal appeals we granted the appellant the indulgence."" The Appeal Court dismissed the appeal and refused his application to receive ""new evidence"". On 18 November 1985, the applicant petitioned the Secretary of State under Section 263 of the Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1975 to remit the matter back to the Appeal Court.  This petition was refused by letter dated 19 March 1986. On 7 June 1985, the applicant had been transferred from Glasgow to Peterhead Prison over 200 miles away.  The applicant wished to pursue his petition and an application before the European Commission of Human Rights, and expressed the desire to be allowed to work full-time in his cell.  In particular, he asked if he could be allowed to remain in his cell or be transferred to the Special Unit of Barlinnie Prison.  An Assistant Governor of the prison indicated to the applicant that none of these options would be appropriate but explained that the applicant could be placed in a separate cell under Rule 36(1) of the Prison (Scotland) Rules 1952. On 24 June 1985 the applicant petitioned the Secretary of State complaining about the Rule 36 conditions and requesting permission to be employed in his own cell ""to study law and procedures"" in pursuit of his case.  He commented that at Peterhead the only way he could pursue his various appeals was ""on Rule 36 in the separate cell area, otherwise I have to be employed full-time on a sewing machine making £3.20 a week"" and that he would have to be exposed to ""the bombardment of the games room for the rest of the evening"".  The applicant indicated that he had ""opted for Rule 36"" because this appeared to be the only way he could spend more time with his files and books.  The applicant asked for ""exemption from employment in the prison industries"" and repeated his request for a transfer to Barlinnie Special Unit ""or to the nearest mental institution"".  In their reply of 12 July the Department replied that the applicant was on Rule 36 conditions at his own insistence, that the Rule 36 conditions had been explained to him fully in an effort to encourage him to follow normal prison routine and that he could be removed from these conditons if he so wished. On 2 November 1985, an incident occurred in the solitary confinement block and a number of prisoners were investigated as to their alleged involvement.  On 3 November, the applicant was visited in his cell by a number of prison officers.  An incident then occurred and the applicant was removed to hospital, where he underwent a life-saving operation and a rupture to the small bowel was repaired. On 10 November 1985, the applicant's solicitor arrived at the hospital to discuss with the applicant the circumstances which led to his admission to hospital.  He had previously been told by the Prison Division that the applicant was in hospital for an appendix operation. The visit had been arranged by the solicitor with the sanction of the prison and hospital staff, and the police who were helping in supervision.  On arrival at the hospital however, the solicitor was told that he had to submit his person and luggage (consisting of the applicant's files and a camera) to a search and that police and prison officers would have to be present at the interview for reasons of security.  The solicitor phoned the Assistant Governor of the prison and explained that the meeting concerned possible Court proceedings but was told that the police were in charge.  The solicitor therefore submitted to the search during which he handed over a small pocket knife with a blade of 2 inches.  The interview was conducted in the presence of police and prison officers, one of whom had been present during the incident of which the applicant was complaining.  The solicitor took pictures of the applicant's injuries with his camera. The door of the room in which the applicant was kept remained open throughout. Following the meeting, the applicant and his solicitor made a formal complaint of assault by the prison officers.  The applicant was later charged with crimes of rioting and assault in respect of the incidents on 2 and 3 November 1985. By letter to the Chief Constable of Grampian Police dated 14 November 1985, the applicant's solicitor complained of the conditions imposed on his visit to the applicant and stated that: ""The meeting with <the applicant> became protracted by virtue of the fact that it was not possible to conduct it in normal conversational tones and we were compelled to discuss the matter in hushed whispers for the sake of preserving some degree of confidentiality."" On return from hospital to Peterhead Prison on 12 November 1985, the applicant was kept apart from the other prisoners under Rule 39 and then Rule 36 of the Prison Rules.  The applicant commenced a hunger-strike in January 1986 in protest over his confinement in Peterhead - he had made several unsuccessful requests to be transferred to Barlinnie in Glasgow to facilitate the communication with his legal advisers. On 23 January 1986, he was transferred on health grounds to the hospital at Barlinnie.  On 14 February 1986, he was returned to Peterhead where he was again placed on Rule 36 conditions, awaiting the outcome of the criminal charges against him. The prosecutor withdrew the charges connected with rioting in May 1986 and on 24 June 1986, the applicant was acquitted of the assault charge. On 14 July 1986 the Governor of Peterhead Prison spoke to the applicant about the continued use of Rule 36 in his case.  The applicant had indicated that if he were removed from Rule 36 and returned to normal conditions he would not expect to be employed in prison work but to continue with his ""appeal"" full-time.  The Governor had told the applicant that such a situation would not be acceptable and the applicant had replied that he would prefer to remain on Rule 36 conditions. By reply dated 29 July 1986 to one of the applicant's petitions the Scottish Home and Health Department stated inter alia ""the prisoner can however be assured that it is understood that he objects to being held under Rule 36 Conditions.  Equally, the prisoner will understand that his continued detention under Rule 36 is a consequence of his own refusal to return to normal circulation and the general prison regime, to enable him to concentrate on possible remedies for his conviction and sentence.  It is of course open to the prisoner to seek return to normal circulation at any time."" In September 1986, the applicant began another hunger-strike and he was transferred to the hospital at Barlinnie Prison on 18 September.  After treatment at Barlinnie for the effects of refusing food the prisoner returned to Peterhead for the second time on 26 September.  After refusing to take food on his return to Peterhead the applicant was again transferred to the hospital at Barlinnie on 6 October.  On 8 October he was transferred to D Hall of Barlinnie Prison.  At Barlinnie the applicant agreed to work and therefore remained in D Hall although still subject to security precautions as a category A prisoner.  He now enjoyed limited association with other prisoners. The applicant has been granted legal aid in order to pursue an action for damages for assault against the Secretary of State for Scotland and it appears that a summons has now been issued instituting proceedings in respect of the incident on 3 November 1985. Domestic law and practice Security categories Under Rule 7 of the Prison (Scotland) Rules 1952 convicted prisoners are classified in accordance with instructions given to the Secretary of State.  Standing Order Fb10 of the Prisons (Scotland) Standing Orders sets out the security categories and how prisoners shall be allocated to them.  All inmates in Scottish penal establishments are placed in one of four security categories A, B, C or D.  Prisoners placed in security category D are those who may reasonably be trusted to serve their sentences in open conditions. Prisoners in category A are those requiring the highest degree of security, who must in no circumstances be allowed to escape because of considerations of public safety or national security.  The number of category A prisoners held at any one time in penal establishments in Scotland is no more than 15 on average (out of a current population of about 5,500 prisoners).  Those in security classification B are those who ought to be kept in very secure conditions. In addition the Governor of a prison must assess which prisoners need be subject to special precautions having regard inter alia to the potential risk of escape.  Prisoners placed on strict escape precautions (SEP) are subject to special conditions affecting inter alia their location and movement within an establishment. Each case is reviewed by the Governor not less than once every three months and no prisoner may be removed from the SEP list without the authority of the Scottish Home and Health Department. Handcuffing of prisoners Under Section 242 of the Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1975 (as amended by the Criminal Justice (Scotland) Act 1980) the Secretary of State has the responsibility for arranging that appellants are transmitted to and from an appeal hearing.  Section 243 of that Act, as amended, states that the Secretary of State shall call sufficient numbers of male and female prison officers to attend the court as, having regard to the list of cases he considers necessary, Section 10 of the Prisons (Scotland) Act 1952 provides that Rules under Section 35 of that Act may provide for the manner in which an appellant when in custody is to be taken to, kept in custody at, and brought back from, the appeal hearing. Rule 23 of the Rules further provides for such prisoners while outside the prison to be kept in the custody of the officers directed by the Governor to convey him to the appeal hearing and Standing Order Fb11 provides that where an inmate who is regarded as being particularly dangerous is to appear at the Appeal Court in Edinburgh it will be for Governors to make special security arrangements. Standing Order Fc10 makes specific provisions regarding the handcuffing of prisoners.  No prisoner produced for any reason to any court of law may be handcuffed while in court except with the permission of the judge.  Handcuffing in courts is an exceptional measure which should normally be considered only if there are reasonable grounds to expect that if unrestrained the inmate would commit an assault in the courtroom and or attempt to escape from it. Visiting conditions Section 10(2) of the 1952 Act provides that where a prisoner is taken to a hospital for medical or surgical treatment he shall, unless the Secretary of State otherwise directs, be kept in custody while being so taken, while at that place, and while being taken back to prison.  By virtue of Rule 1, the Rules extend where appropriate to prisoners in hospital as they do to prisoners in prison.  Rule 74(2) of the Rules covers visits to convicted prisoners and Standing Order Mb sets out detailed provision for visits.  Visits by legal advisers are provided for in Rules 76 and 77 and Standing Orders Mf7 and Mb20. Applications by prisoners to the Commission are covered by Standing Order Mf.  Rule 76 of the 1952 Rules provides that the legal adviser of a prisoner shall be given reasonable facilities to consult him on any legal business.  In particular, the interview shall take place in the sight but not in the hearing of an officer.  Standing Order Mf7 provides that in relation to a petition to the Commission a legal adviser may visit an inmate without first obtaining a visiting order and that visits between an inmate and his legal adviser for this purpose should be in sight, but not in the hearing of, a prison officer. Restriction of association: Rule 36 Rule 36 of the Rules provides as follows: ""(1)  If at any time it appears to the Visiting Committee or the Secretary of State that it is desirable for the maintenance of good order or discipline, or in the interests of a prisoner, that he should not be employed in association with others, the Visiting Committee or the Secretary of State may authorise the Governor to arrange for him to work in a cell, and not in association, for a period not exceeding one month from the date of each authorisation. (2)  The Governor may arrange for any such prisoner to be employed in association again whenever he considers this desirable, and he shall so arrange if in any case the Medical Officer so advise on medical grounds."" Rule 36 does not require any placement to be at the request of the prisoner.  The judgment rests with the Secretary of State (or Visiting Committee).  However, removal from association at work under Rule 36 is normally applied at a prisoner's own request when the individual prisoner is seeking protection from other inmates (because of his offence, previous associations etc).  The use of Rule 36 at a prisoner's own request is not, however, confined to ""protection"". Rule 36 does not exclude removal from association at work at a prisoner's own request for other reasons.  Rule 36 is not a punishment for a disciplinary offence.  Disciplinary offences are punished in accordance with Rules 42 to 47 inclusive. COMPLAINTS 1.      The applicant contends that he suffered inhuman and degrading treatment through being manacled throughout his appeal hearing.  He invokes Article 3 (Art. 3) of the Convention. 2.      The applicant complains that the conditions imposed on his solicitor on his visit to the applicant while in hospital (in particular the presence of police and prison officers, one of whom took part in the incident in which the applicant received his injury) attempted to intimidate him and in effect impeded the exercise of his right of access to Court.  The presence of the police and prison officers throughout the interview also interfered with his right to receive and impart information.  The applicant invokes in this respect Articles 6 para. 1 and 10 (Art. 6-1, Art. 10) of the Convention. 3.      He also complains that as a result of a desire to work on his petition and application to the European Commission of Human Rights he has been placed in solitary confinement. PROCEEDINGS BEFORE THE COMMISSION The application was introduced on 5 July 1985 and registered on 8 August 1986. On 6 March 1987, the Commission decided to bring the application to the notice of the respondent Government in relation to the applicant's complaints concerning access to solicitor, being manacled in court and being kept in solitary confinement because of his intention to pursue his application to the Commission.  The respondent Government was invited to submit written observations on admissibility and merits pursuant to Rule 42(2)b of the Rules of Procedure of the Commission.  The Government was also invited for an explanation of the applicant's complaints of solitary confinement in the context of Article 25 para. 1 (Art. 25-1) in fine of the Convention.  The applicant's remaining complaints were held inadmissible in a partial decision on admissibility dated 6 March 1987. Observations from the respondent Government were submitted on 2 June 1987 and observations in reply submitted by the applicant on 6 August 1987. On 16 October 1987, the Commission decided to grant legal aid to the applicant in respect of his application. On 9 March 1988, the Commission decided to invite the parties to a hearing on the admissibility and merits of the application concerning the issues arising under Article 6 (Art. 6) of the Convention in relation to the handcuffing and the applicant's access to his solicitor. At the hearing which was held on 13 July 1988, the parties were represented as follows: The respondent Government Mr.  M.C.Wood,        Agent Mr.  G.W. Penrose,    Q.C. Mrs.  M. Macdonald,   Scottish Office, Adviser Mr.  C. Reeves,       Scottish Home and Health Department, Adviser Miss L. Cumming,     Crown Office, Adviser Mr.  C. McLean,       United Kingdom Permanent Representative to the Council of Europe The applicant Mr.  J. Carroll,      Solicitor Mr.  D. Small,        Advocate SUBMISSIONS OF THE PARTIES A. THE RESPONDENT GOVERNMENT 1. The facts The applicant was convicted of crimes which involved extreme violence, were carefully planned and carried out as part of a protracted and violent confrontation between rivals in the ice-cream war in Glasgow. While in custody on remand from 14 May 1984, the applicant was under strict escape precautions (SEP).  Upon his conviction on 10 October 1984 he was classified in security category B, and remained on the SEP list.  Upon his transfer from Barlinnie to Peterhead Prison on 7 June 1985 the applicant remained as a category B prisoner and on the SEP list.  On 4 November 1985, following a serious escape attempt by a number of prisoners and the taking of hostages, the applicant and a number of others were reclassified as category A prisoners.  He has remained in this category and on the SEP list since then. Category B prisoners are those who do not require maximum security but who ought to be kept in very secure conditions.  The classification of the applicant as category A reflected the view of the prison authorities that he should be regarded as a prisoner requiring the highest degree of security.  Classification in category A is appropriate among other circumstances where the prisoner's violent behaviour is such that members of the public or the police would be in danger of their lives if he were at liberty. The appeal On the calling of his appeal on 16 May 1985 the applicant entered the Court with a cardboard box or carton full of papers.  As is customary with an appellant in custody he was flanked on either side by a prison officer.  During the hearing he remained handcuffed to one prison officer, his other hand remaining free.  Because of the potential security risk, in addition to the larger than usual number of prison officers in the building, police officers were also present in the court during the hearing of the appeal. At the start of his submissions the applicant asked the Lord Justice Clerk, who presided, if he would order that the handcuffs be removed but this request was refused.  It is, however, understood that the Lord Justice Clerk suggested that the prison officer to whom the applicant was handcuffed should assist as much as he could with regard to access to the applicant's papers. In the event, as the Court's Opinion bears out, the applicant did not require to consult his papers regularly during the presentation of his appeal.  All the papers which he had lodged with the Clerk of Justiciary prior to the hearing had been copied for each of the three judges and the Crown were also in possession of copies. Further, the applicant had prepared a written ""summary of his grounds of appeal"", copies of which he produced at the hearing for each of the judges and for the Crown. Owing to an increased concern regarding a possible security risk in the event that the applicant's appeal was refused, there was a police presence at court on 4 June when the Court's Opinion was delivered and a police escort was provided for the prison in which the applicant was conveyed to and from prison. Peterhead Prison, 7 June - 4 November 1985 The Government explain that at Peterhead Prison most inmates are required to go to workshops, where appropriate work is provided, for approximately four hours per day.  This requirement ensures a period of time out of cell in association with other prisoners as well as constructive activity for the individual.  Inmates are only excused work, and allowed to remain in their cells, for medical reasons on the advice of the Medical Office.  Some inmates, engaged on domestic duties, do not go to workshops but are still required to work on specified duties under supervision at other locations in the prison. At Peterhead Prison, the normal weekday régime centres on periods of employment in the workshops or on specific domestic duties during the day.  Apart from those under medical observation (who have to remain in their cells) all other prisoners are taken from the main halls (A and D Halls) to place of work elsewhere in the prison.  Refusal to work is a disciplinary offence under Rule 42(3).  Any prisoner who refuses to work after a disciplinary adjudication may be punished, in accordance with Rule 43, with punishments such as loss of privileges. At Peterhead Prison, prisoners who have to be held out of normal association are located in the separate cells block (which has 15 cells).  The separate cells are used for prisoners who have been removed from association at work, in accordance with Rule 36, at their own request or at the Governor's initiative in the interests of good order and discipline.  They are also used for prisoners who have received punishments of cellular confinement.  While in the separate cells at Peterhead the applicant was in the cell for between 22 and 23 hours per day, with the remainder of the time outside his cell for exercise and ablutions.  He was not, however, denied access to and use of personal property, including his radio, nor to facilities for the preparation of his Strasbourg case.  In particular, his location in the separate cells in no way affected his entitlement to visit from family and friends or from his solicitor. Subsequently, on or about 16 August 1985, the Assistant Governor discussed the situation with the applicant and sought to persuade him to return to the normal routine of the prison.  The applicant refused since he considered that he would not receive adequate provision for study. On 9 August 1985 the Governor of Peterhead Prison requested authority for the applicant to continue to be placed on Rule 36 conditions for one month from 11 August 1985.  The request indicated that the applicant continued to be busily engaged with legal correspondence and that he still did not wish to return to normal circulation, although free to do so.  In giving authority for the continued use of Rule 36 the Department asked whether the prisoner could not be persuaded to return to normal circulation. On 16 August 1985, following discussion with the applicant, an Assistant Governor at Peterhead reported to the Department that the applicant could not be persuaded to return to normal circulation and would not consider such a move to be in his best interests while he had to ""concentrate on his appeal"".  The applicant had indicated that he accepted the likelihood of punishment following such a refusal but suggested the ""absolute remedy"" - a transfer to the Barlinnie Special Unit. The applicant remained on Rule 36 conditions until a serious incident took place in the separate cells in Peterhead Prison on 2 November 1985.  Following the incident the applicant was relocated in B Hall of the prison.  There was a further incident in B Hall on 3 November, and in the early morning of 4 November the applicant was transferred to Aberdeen Royal Infirmary after complaining of abdominal pains. Aberdeen Royal Infirmary, 4 - 12 November 1985 In the interests of security the cooperation of the local (Grampian) police was requested in respect of the applicant's detention at Aberdeen Royal Infirmary.  In hospital the applicant was attended at all times by two prison officers. The applicant's solicitor, Mr.  Carroll, arrived at Aberdeen Royal Infirmary to see his client at about 13.30 on 10 November 1985. He refused to be searched by the uniformed police officers on duty and insisted on the attendance of CID officers.  Not more than 40 minutes later three CID officers arrived.  Mr.  Carroll was informed that he could visit the applicant only if he consented to being searched.  The visit started at about 14.15 and finished at about 16.00.  The room in which the visit took place was a single room, located several storeys from the ground, which the applicant occupied as the only patient. For the duration of the interview the two prison officers and three police officers withdrew from the room to the corridor leaving the door open.  They remained some ten feet away from the solicitor and his client. Peterhead and Barlinnie prison, November 1985 - 1987 Following an incident at Barlinnie Prison on 1 January 1987 the applicant was placed in solitary confinement under Rule 36.  In May 1987, the applicant was returned to Peterhead but was again transferred to Barlinnie following a hunger-strike.  He apparently has been since kept in the prison hospital at Barlinnie in the interests of good order and discipline in the prison. 2. Admissibility and merits Interference with access to solicitor: Article 6 para. 1 (Art. 6-1) The Government do not accept that the prison authorities or the police refused to allow the applicant to have a consultation with his solicitor out of the hearing of prison or police officers.  It was in the circumstances perfectly feasible for the applicant and the solicitor to talk without being overheard by the officers, who were outside the room in a hospital corridor and remained some ten feet distant. The Government would further recall that in paragraph 113 of the Campbell and Fell judgment (Eur.  Court H.R., Campbell and Fell judgment of 28 June 1984, Series A No. 80), the Court indicated that, as was pointed out by the Commission, ""there may well be security considerations which would justify some restriction on the conditions for visits by a lawyer to a prisoner"".  And paragraph 159 of the Commission's report in Campbell and Fell reads: ""The Commission recognises that there may be specific circumstances in which some interference in the contact between a lawyer and other persons may be justified (see e.g.  Application No. 8290/78, A, B, C and D v. the Federal Republic of Germany, Decisions and Reports No. 18 p. 176; Application No. 8463/78, Kröcher and Möller v.  Switzerland, Decision of 9 July 1983)."" Thus it is not every interference with access to legal advice that hinders the effective exercise of the right of access to court. Further those cases where the Convention organs previously considered temporary hindrance of access involved being substantial delays of months or even years. In the Government's submission, any restrictions placed on the conditions for Mr.  Carroll's visit on 10 November 1985 were amply justified by security considerations.  The applicant was a category A prisoner, that is to say, one who ought to be kept in very secure conditions and was temporarily in a civilian hospital, the Aberdeen Royal Infirmary, where the normal facilities for prison visits were not available.  While there was a sealed observation window giving a view into the room from the corridor, the door was also kept open as it was considered that direct access into the room was required to enable immediate response to any situation requiring police intervention.  For the reasons given above, the Government submit that there was, in the circumstances of this case, no interference with the applicant's right of access to a court.  In the alternative, the Government submit that any interference was clearly justified by security considerations. Handcuffing before the Appeal Court: Article 6 para. 1 (Art. 6-1) The Government would first recall that the fact that an accused appears in court in handcuffs is less significant in appeal proceedings (where the accused has already been convicted and where no jury is present) than in the trial itself.  In any event, the applicant's complaint appears to be essentially that the handcuffs prevented him from consulting his papers properly.  The Government submit that this complaint is unsupported by the facts.  In the Government's submission, the fact of the applicant being handcuffed by one hand during his appeal did not in practice impede his ability to consult his papers.  Moreover, it is difficult to see how the applicant can claim that he was ""considerably hampered"" in presenting his appeal when the Court's Opinion discloses that he made his submissions by reading from a document which had been prepared in advance and which he himself described as ""summary of his grounds of appeal"".  The applicant also stated that his submissions were all included in the summary and he asked and was given permission to read this document to the court.  When he was finished he was asked if he wished to add anything to what he had already said and he replied in the negative.  He indicated at no time that he was in any way prevented from having access to any document. The Government would recall that the applicant was given a second opportunity to address the court: he requested and was given permission to answer some of the points made by the Advocate Depute. As the Court's Opinion explains a second or further speech is contrary to the normal procedure in criminal appeals but nevertheless the permission was granted.  The applicant had been legally represented at his trial and received the assistance of his solicitors in preparation of his appeal.  It was as a result of his own decision that he presented his own appeal. The Government stress that the applicant was afforded every opportunity to present his submissions on his grounds of appeal and was shown considerable indulgence by the court at the hearing.  The handcuffing may have amounted to an inconvenience but it is submitted that mere inconvenience does not constitute a breach of Article 6 para. 1 (Art. 6-1).  In conclusion, the Government would recall the constant case-law of the Convention organs whereby the fairness of proceedings for the purposes of Article 6 para. 1 (Art. 6-1) ""must be decided on basis of a consideration of the trial as a whole, and not on the basis of an isolated consideration of one particular aspect of the trial or one particular incident"" and would submit that, in the circumstances, the applicant was afforded a fair hearing and that no violation of Article 6 para. 1 (Art. 6-1) occurred. Article 25 para. 1 in fine (Art. 25-1) There is no factual basis for the assertion that by placing of the applicant on Rule 36 conditions the authorities hindered the effective exercise of the applicant's right to apply to the Commission. The placing of the applicant on Rule 36 conditions was in no sense aimed at deterring the applicant from making such an application or punishing him.  On the contrary, as is explained above, the measure was taken, at the applicant's option, so as to enable him to devote more of his time to his application than would have been possible under the ordinary prison régime. While Rule 36 covers a removal from association at work, and normally also has the effect of removal from recreation and association, it is not a punishment and does not involve the removal of other privileges.  The applicant had explained to him the consequences of his wanting to pursue his application full-time (in the separate cells at Peterhead) as opposed to part-time (in the time available to him in the evenings and weekends) and opted of his own volition to be placed on Rule 36 conditions.  His being on Rule 36 conditions resulted from his own wish to pursue his Strasbourg application full-time.  Prison management might have disregarded this wish and insisted that the applicant participate in the normal prison régime and face the disciplinary consequences of refusal to work. Repeated efforts were made to persuade the applicant to return to normal circulation at Peterhead but did not succeed because of his preference to work full-time on his case. The Government submit that it is clear that the applicant's placement on Rule 36 conditions in no way hindered the exercise of his right to petition the Commission but was in fact the result of his insistence that he had to work on his application full-time.  Thus placement on Rule 36 facilitated the applicant's application.  Had he taken part in the normal régime at Peterhead the applicant would have worked in prison industry leaving him evenings and weekends for the preparation of his case. Finally, the Government would recall that some of the periods which the applicant spent on Rule 36 conditions had no connection with the preparation of his case in Strasbourg. B. THE APPLICANT 1. The facts The applicant does not admit that he was under ""short escape precautions"" while a remand prisoner.  He contends that he has never been involved in any attempt or escape and that there is no reason to believe that he was likely to become so involved.  The applicant notes that he was classified as category B following conviction. The appeal The applicant states that he was at all times handcuffed by his right hand to a prison officer.  He is right-handed.  The applicant has no knowledge of the ""security risk"" or ""increased concern"" over security to which the respondent Government refer as justification for their actions. The applicant denies that any suggestion was even made to the effect that any prison officer should assist him with his papers.  The applicant notes that at his trial neither he nor his co-accused were required to remain in handcuffs.  He is also ignorant of the reasons for the decision to classify him as category A in November 1985. Peterhead Prison, 7 June - 4 November 1985 On transfer to Peterhead on 7 June 1985 the applicant was informed that the only facility that could be made available, if he persisted in his appeal and application to the Commission, would be under Rule 36 of the Prison (Scotland) Rules 1952.  This rule provides for withdrawal of association at work and allows for a prisoner, where it is in his interests, to carry out work in his cell.  It does not provide for cellular confinement, which is provided for elsewhere in the Rules as a punishment in itself.  The applicant was told that the invoking of Rule 36 would involve him being in a cell in the separate cell block of the prison.  Since then the applicant has made repeated requests to be allowed the normal facility of association and recreation albeit accepting that he would not be employed in association with other prisoners as clearly stated in the Prison (Scotland) Rules. The respondent Government states that refusal to work is a disciplinary offence subject to punishment under Rule 43.  This rule provides for cellular confinement, i.e. solitary confinement, as a distinct and separate punishment in itself.  If it is the Respondent's argument that the applicant was placed on Rule 36 at his own insistence and in regard to his own interests then it seems remarkable that the separate and distinct punishment of cellular confinement should be imposed in addition thereto.  Accordingly, the applicant is driven to the conclusion that Rule 36 as it is applied to him is a form of punishment for which no provision is made under the specific provision.  In addition, the sworn testimony of a prison officer, during the trial in the High Court at Peterhead, made it plain that the applicant was being kept in solitary confinement because of his complaint to the European Commission of Human Rights.  The applicant also submits that the Secretary of State's reply of 12 July 1985 to his petition makes it clear that Rule 36 is regarded as punishment or a form of coercion, given that Rule 36 provides only for withdrawal of association at work. In discussion with the Governor's assistant the applicant recalls that he was prevailed upon to enter into the normal routine of the prison, but on questioning was clearly given to understand that normal routine meant that no provision for study would be given; and normal routine did not accommodate those prisoners who would not accept without protest their conviction or sentence.  The applicant's ""wish"" was not for Rule 36 but to continue his appeal and complaint to the Commission. Aberdeen Royal Infirmary On arrival at the hospital on 10 November 1985, the applicant's solicitor was met by police officers and obliged to wait 40 minutes to speak to CID officers.  The applicant's solicitor was then required to submit to a search before he was allowed to visit the applicant.  The room in which the applicant was a patient was at the end of a corridor in the ward of a modern hospital.  There was a large observation window on the wall giving on to the corridor and the whole interior of the room was capable of view from any part of the adjacent corridor.  The opaque glass in the top half of the door to the room could also be slid back to allow observation into the room.  The applicant notes that during the interview a number of hospital staff, including a cleaner, came into the room but there was no interference made with their rights of movement.  Members of the public visiting other patients in rooms very nearby were also allowed free movement. For the duration of the applicant's meeting with Mr.  Carroll there was always at least one of the two prison officers seated at the open door of the room with his feet not less than eighteen inches from the threshold.  Whilst the prison officers tended to respect the ""barrier"" of the threshold, the police did not.  Throughout the interview the police would come to the door of the room and stand leaning against the door post.  There were three police officers from the Criminal Investigation Department and they took it in irregular turns to come to the room and stand in the doorway.  The doorway was about six feet from the head of the applicant as he sat in his bed and was well within earshot for conversation even in subdued tones.  It was the stated intention of Detective Sergeant Duncan that the police would at all times be within the hearing of the interview.  The presence of the prison officers and police clearly caused distress to the applicant. He was asked what it was that caused him to be brought to the hospital and leaned forward whispering that he dare not say because prison officers had sought to make a deal with him that if he keep quiet they will not have him charged with involvement in hostage taking and riot in the prison, an incident referred to by the respondent Government as having occurred on 2 November 1985.  In the event the applicant was persuaded to speak and he related an account of an alleged attack on him.  One detective constable and Detective Sergeant Duncan were called right into the room.  Bruises were pointed out on the applicant's left leg, his arms, back and the general area of the right lower back.  In addition, the attention of the officers was drawn to clearly visible marks of ratchet type handcuffs on the wrists.  The police were told that the applicant was reporting an alleged assault by prison officers on 3 November 1985 and wished the police to make enquiry. It was later learned that the police failed to act on that report and the applicant was to find himself charged with involvement in riot and hostage-taking.  He was also charged with assaulting one of the very officers named in the report to the police as having assaulted him. 2. Domestic law and practice Handcuffing of prisoners The applicant contends that handcuffing of prisoners is more common than would appear from the respondent Government's observations. Although it is said that the permission of the judge must be sought, it does not appear that permission was sought in the case of the applicant. Rule 36 Rule 36 provides for withdrawal of association at work and does not provide for denial of work or cellular confinement or denial of any association with other prisoners.  Where the Secretary of State chooses to exercise powers in Rule 36 it is plain that he must do so outwith considerations of punishment.  In the applicant's case, he was advised that Rule 36 would be applied to allow his request to look after his own interests in preparing his appeal to the Secretary of State and complaints to the Commission.  As the replies to the applicant's various petitions to the Secretary of State and the respondent Government's observations make it plain, Rule 36 has been used as a guise or cover for conditions of punishment or coercion directly related to the applicant's refusal to abandon his complaints to the Commission. While Rule 36 is not designed to be a punishment, the applicant submits that definite forms of punishment have been brought to bear upon the applicant.  These forms of punishment are provided for in Rules 42 to 47.  These, as applied to the applicant, include: a) forfeiture of ""privileges"" in the form of association with other prisoners in recreation or indeed any form of recreation; b) cellular confinement. Safeguards are built in to the Rules in respect of cellular confinement.  These are that in the first instance it must not exceed three days.  Where there are serious or repeated offences against the Rules, cellular confinement is not to exceed fourteen days.  And, only in the most grievous offence of mutiny or incitement to mutiny can cellular confinement be extended to a maximum of twenty-eight days. In addition to these safeguards, Rule 46 provides that cellular confinement shall not be awarded unless the Medical Officer has certified that the prisoner is in a fit condition to sustain it.  It is implicit that this includes mental as well as physical condition since it will doubtless be conceded that solitary confinement is a danger to mental as well as physical wellbeing.  Further, Rule 46(2) provides that the prisoner be visited at least once a day by the Governor and by the Medical Officer and at intervals of not more than three hours during the day by an officer detailed by the Governor. While purportedly subject to Rule 36 the applicant was offered none of the safeguards provided for by statutory instruction and was taken only once to see a psychiatrist some months into the period of solitary confinement. 3. Admissibility and merits Interference with access to solicitor: Article 6 (Art. 6) of the Convention The applicant submits that it is irrelevant that a complaint was eventually made or that legal aid has been granted to pursue an action for damages.  The right of unimpeded access to the court carries with it the right to unimpeded access to a solicitor for the purpose of receiving advice and assistance in connection with the possible institution of civil proceedings.  It forms an inseparable part of the right of access to the courts themselves (see Eur.  Court H.R., Golder judgment of 21 February 1975, Series A No. 18). The applicant, while in Aberdeen Royal Infirmary, was clearly a possible suspect or witness in relation to the disturbance at Peterhead Prison on 2 November 1985.  The prison authorities would also have been contemplating inquiry or charges in respect of the incident on 3 November 1985 when the applicant suffered injury.  In the Prisons Register of Punishments there is an entry dated 3 November 1985 indicating that a prison officer Cormack was to charge the applicant with assault.  Both prison staff and police would clearly be keen to learn what the applicant had to say on these matters and the prison authorities in particular would naturally be reluctant to have the applicant level any accusation or charge against any prison officer. The Prison (Scotland) Rules make it an offence against discipline to make a false and malicious allegation against an officer.  It is, in the Rules, for the Governor to decide whether an allegation is false and malicious and he is authorised to punish the prisoner in various ways defined in the regulations quite apart from detention in solitary confinement while the matter is being investigated.  Punishment can include loss of remission on sentence, which is effectively the imposition of a custodial sentence on the prisoner.  In knowledge of this provision the applicant was in fear of making a full statement to his solicitor and of making his complaint to the police.  In the event the applicant did make a full statement to his solicitor and did report the matter to the police. The applicant submits imposing conditions such as the requirement of the legal adviser to submit to assault of search and invasion of privacy coupled with the requirement that prison and police officers should be within hearing throughout consultation and advising goes beyond what is permitted by law and was wholly unnecessary in the circumstances.  It was not a foregone conclusion that the solicitor would agree to a search and he could have left without seeing the applicant.  He denies the assertion of the Government that the prison and police officers were out of range of hearing the interview.  Further the presence of the prison and police officers caused distress to the applicant.  He had been told by the prison officer that if he kept quiet he would not be charged with involvement in the rioting on 2 November 1985. The applicant also submits that the respondent Government have not substantiated their allusions to security considerations.  It has not been alleged that the applicant's solicitor (an ex-police officer and ex-procurator fiscal depute) has ever been considered as a danger to security.  Further the room in which the applicant was held had far greater opportunity for visual observation than the normal prison interview room and was also at the end of a corridor several storeys above the ground with no means of escape through the window.  The applicant in any case was incapable of presenting any danger having undergone laporotomy bowel re-section and appedectomy six days earlier. The applicant states that there was a clear, concerted and unwarranted interference therefore with his right of unimpeded access to the court by virtue of unimpeded access to his solicitor.  He submits that this was a clear abuse of position by the authorities and a clear attempt to intimidate or silence him in respect of his complaints. Handcuffing before the Appeal Court: Article 6 para. 1 (Art. 6-1) of the Convention The applicant refers to his trial on May 1986, when he was again manacled on appearance in court though the manacles were removed after request by his counsel.  This incident also illustrated that the authorities had failed to approach the court for consent to the handcuffing in court.  It is submitted that this incident provides corroboration for the applicant's assertion that the authorities fail to have due regard to safeguards built into their own standing orders for the protection of the interests of justice.  Despite anything that may be said the applicant avers that there remains no legal authority for manacling accused persons in the courts of Scotland and doubts whether there is any legal authority elsewhere in the United Kingdom. The applicant did not say that his submissions were all included in the summary but said: ""Everything here is on my grounds, yes"".  The applicant had lodged a great number of grounds of appeal and a vast quantity of material with the court and submits that it would be impossible to seriously suggest that a paper providing notes on a few of the points could be regarded as the sum total of his submissions.  The applicant read the notes, after attempting to address the court previously on other points of appeal.  He was asked by the Lord Justice Clerk if he had anything more to add and replied: ""Not for now"".  It was clear that the applicant was not finished and a cursory examination of the grounds of appeal previously submitted would have disclosed that.  If the court had thought the applicant was finished at that or any other time it should, with an unrepresented appellant, have taken the reasonable step of confirming whether or not he was departing from any of the grounds of appeal.  Such a practice is operated with represented appellants.  After the prosecutor's submissions the applicant sought to reply.  This was the first time the applicant had had disclosed to him the prosecution's grounds of opposition to the appeal. Advocacy is regarded as one of the most difficult and stressful aspects of legal practice, and that is for trained lawyers not even closely connected with the matter before the court.  It involves an attempt to persuade the court, by reference to fact and law, to reach a particular conclusion.  In the Appeal Court advocacy is taken to even greater heights since it involves seeking to persuade the court to overturn the decision of another court, in this case a Supreme Court.  Anything that undermines the concentration, self-esteem or confidence of the pleader in his argument puts him at a disadvantage.  Stripping the applicant of his dignity by shackling him to a prison officer, preventing him taking notes and properly reaching and referring to his papers was bound to so disadvantage and deprive the applicant of a fair hearing. While accepting the decision of the Commission that manacling in this case did not amount to degrading treatment within the meaning of Article 3 (Art. 3) the applicant did, nonetheless, feel humiliated and undermined and caused him to lose confidence and concentration.  He was, through no fault of his own, without legal representation and the nature of his case was such that he was deserving of better consideration and facilities to argue it.  The facts disclose that the applicant was at a considerable disadvantage and was accordingly unable to plead his case.  In saying so the applicant does not think that he would ever have been able to plead his case to the same standard as the prosecutor but he would have done better than he did and, importantly, would have been able to properly draw the attention of the court to the error it made in misdirecting itself as to the facts of one of his grounds of appeal. The applicant also submits that handcuffing of the applicant throughout the whole of the hearings on the appeal cannot be regarded merely as ""one particular aspect"" or ""one particular incident"".  The applicant did not have legal representation, was not assisted in the manner of contemporaneous research as the hearing progressed and the prosecution's submissions were being made, was prevented from taking notes for use throughout the hearing and could not properly refer to his papers and books which were taken into court and left just out of reach.  He was unable to properly reach for and refer to his papers or to take notes during the various verbal exchanges or during the submissions of the prosecutor. Article 25 para. 1 in fine (Art. 25-1) As regards his confinement under Rule 36, the applicant was presented with no reasonable option.  The normal routine of Peterhead Prison makes no facilities available to prepare a case for petition to the Secretary of State under Section 263 of the Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act, 1975 nor for presentation to the Commission.  The authorities appear to regard the matters to be dealt with as a hobby or pastime to be indulged in during leisure moments.  The applicant merely requested that he be allowed the time, in the daytime quiet of a normal accommodation cell block, to prepare notes on his trial to enable him to instruct his lawyer in the matter of further appeal and an application to the Commission.  It would have been unreasonable to expect the applicant to do this work in the ordinary accommodation block after hours or in a recreation hall where the noise of other prisoners and their radios would drown out proper thought.  Prisoners are regularly left in their own cell block during working hours for various reasons and one more would have made no difference.  Such prisoners left in their own cell block may well even have been subject to Rule 36 properly operated, simply withdrawn from association at work.  The purported operation of Rule 36 in the applicant's case was clearly a deterrent or impediment or punishment for making application to the Commission and/or maintaining his demand for facilities to further his petition to the Secretary of State under Section 263.  The difficult and soul destroying conditions of solitary confinement are wellknown to be a danger to good physical and mental wellbeing, and were obviously a deterrent to the applicant to pursue his complaint. The applicant contends that by choosing to refer to solitary confinement as Rule 36 the prison authorities circumvent the legal and medical safeguards built into the Prison (Scotland) Rules.  Solitary confinement is one of the most serious punishments to be inflicted on a prisoner and, accordingly, there is no practical distinction in Rule 36 as applied to the applicant and the serious punishment provisions elsewhere in the Rules. THE LAW 1.      The applicant complains that he was hampered in the presentation of his appeal before the High Court of Justiciary as a result of being handcuffed throughout the proceedings to a prison officer. The applicant originally complained of the handcuffing in the context of Article 3 (Art. 3) of the Convention.  The Commission however found in its Partial Decision on Admissibility of 6 March 1987 that while no issue arose under this provision, an issue might arise under Article 6 para. 1 (Art. 6-1) of the Convention.  The Commission has therefore examined the applicant's complaints in light of Article 6 para. 1 (Art. 6-1) of the Convention which provides: ""In the determination of his civil rights and obligations or of any criminal charge against him, everyone is entitled to a fair and public hearing within a reasonable time by an independent and impartial tribunal established by law..."" The Commission notes first of all that although Article 6 (Art. 6) of the Convention does not guarantee an appeal in criminal proceedings, where the opportunity to lodge an appeal in regard to the determination of a criminal charge is provided under domestic law, as in this case, the guarantees of Article 6 (Art. 6) continue to apply to the appeal proceedings, since those proceedings form part of the whole proceedings which determine the criminal charge at issue (see e.g. Eur.  Court H.R., Delcourt judgment of 17 January 1970, Series A No. 11 pp. 13-15 and Eur. Court H.R., Monnell and Morris judgment of 2 March 1987, Series A No. 115, p. 21 para.54). The Commission also recalls that the question of whether a hearing conforms to the standards laid down in Article 6 para. 1 (Art. 6-1) must be decided on the basis of an evaluation of the proceedings in their entirety and not on the basis of an isolated consideration of any one particular incident or aspect (see e.g. Application Nos. 343/57, Dec. 2.5.59, Yearbook 4 p. 548; 5574/72, Dec. 21.3.75, D.R. 3 p. 10; 7306/75, Dec. 6.10.76, D.R. 7 p. 115 and 8744/79, Dec. 2.3.83, D.R. 32 p. 141). The Commission has accordingly looked at the proceedings as a whole on the basis of the parties' submissions. The Government have submitted that in light of crimes of which the applicant had been convicted, the handcuffing of the applicant while out of prison to attend the court was required in the interests of security.  The Commission however is not called upon to decide whether or not the handcuffing was justified by security considerations though it would in this regard refer to its previous case-law where it has stated that handcuffing of a prisoner in public is an undesirable measure (see e.g.  Application No. 2291/64, Dec. 1.6.67).  The Commission's task is to determine whether the applicant received a fair trial within the meaning of Article 6 para. 1 (Art. 6-1) of the Convention. The Commission recalls that the applicant was legally represented at his trial and that he received assistance from his solicitors in preparing and submitting his grounds of appeal.  The Commission notes that in presenting his appeal the applicant read out prepared written submissions.  The Lord Justice Clerk in the Opinion of the Court on the applicant's appeal stated: ""When he was called upon to make his submissions in support of his grounds of appeal the appellant stated that they were all included in the said summary and asked the Court's leave simply to read that document to the Court.  Such leave was granted and he read the document to the Court. When he had done so he was asked if he wished to add anything to what he had already submitted and he replied in the negative.  The learned Advocate Depute replied, and the appellant then sought leave to answer some of the points made by the Advocate Depute.  Although this further speech is contrary to normal procedure in criminal appeals we granted the appellant the indulgence."" The Commission further notes that the transcript of the proceedings submitted by the applicant reveals no evidence that the applicant expressed any difficulty in reaching for or referring to any of his documents during the two day hearing. In light of these circumstances, the Commission finds no indication that the applicant was prevented from adequately presenting his appeal and that accordingly the Commission finds that the applicant has failed to show that the handcuffing deprived him of a fair trial within the meaning of Article 6 para. 1 (Art. 6-1) of the Convention. It follows that this complaint is manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 27 para. 2 (Art. 27-2) of the Convention. 2.      The applicant has also complained that the conditions imposed on the visit of his solicitor at the hospital constituted an unwarranted interference with his right of unimpeded access to court contrary to Article 6 para. 1 (Art. 6-1) of the Convention. The case-law of the Court and the Commission has established that Article 6 para. 1 (Art. 6-1) guarantees to everyone an effective right of access to the courts for the determination of his civil rights and obligations (see e.g.  Eur. Court H.R., Golder judgment of 21 February 1975, Series A No. 18 para. 36).  The Commission recalls that the applicant's solicitor visited the applicant in hospital following an incident in which the applicant received injuries necessitating a major operation to his abdomen.  Subsequent to the visit, the applicant has instituted proceedings against the Secretary of State seeking damages for these injuries.  The Commission is satisfied in these circumstances that the visit of the solicitor concerned potential civil litigation in respect of the applicant's civil rights and that Article 6 para. 1 (Art. 6-1) is applicable.  The Commission must therefore determine whether there has been an interference with the applicant's right of access to court in this matter contrary to Article 6 para. 1 (Art. 6-1) of the Convention. The Commission notes that while in the hospital the applicant was held in a room giving onto a hospital corridor.  There was an observation window set into the wall between the room and the corridor, and the opaque glass in the top half of the door to the room could be adjusted to allow further observation.  The parties vary as to several of the details concerning the solicitor's visit.  The Commission finds it established however that following the solicitor's arrival at the hospital at approximately 13h30 on 10 November 1985, the police officers insisted for security reasons that he submit to a search of his person and belongings before visiting the applicant. During the search, a small pen knife was handed over to the police. When the visit took place, two prison officers and at least two police officers were present outside the room, the door to which remained open throughout.  It appears from the submissions of the parties and the dimensions of the room as indicated on the plan of the hospital, that the police and prison officers when at the doorway to the room would have been between 8-10 feet from the head of the bed in which the applicant was lying. The Commission and the Court have already in several cases considered the compatibility with the Convention of the restrictions imposed on the visits of solicitors to prisoners.  In Campbell and Fell, the Court found a violation of Article 6 para. 1 (Art. 6-1) of the Convention, where Father Fell had, for two months, been refused permission to consult his solicitors out of hearing of a prison officer (Eur.  Court H.R., Campbell and Fell judgment of 28 June 1984, Series A No. 80, paras. 111-113).  In Applications Nos. 7879/77, 7931/77, 7935/77 and 7930/77 (Comm. Report 3.12.85) the Commission found a violation of Article 6 para. 1 (Art. 6-1) where four prisoners were refused confidential consultation with their solicitors out of hearing of any prison officer.  The Commission stated: ""In the Campbell and Fell case, the Commission referred to the generally accepted principle in Contracting States of privileged communications between a lawyer and his client, enabling the latter to discuss his affairs in confidence and without fear of repercussions or prejudice to possible civil litigation he may pursue.  To prevent such confidential communications concerning possible litigation is to interfere with the right of access to court under Article 6 para. 1 (Art. 6-1) of the Convention.  Although certain exceptions to this principle may be justified, a general prohibition on privileged lawyer/client consultations in prison is not compatible with Article 6 para. 1 (Art. 6-1) of the Convention (Comm.  Report 12.5.82 paras. 157-159).  The Commission also considered, having found a breach of Article 6 para. 1 (Art. 6-1) of the Convention in the particular circumstances of Father Fell's case, that it was unnecessary to consider the same complaint under Article 8 (Art. 8) of the Convention (ibid paras. 160 and 161)."" The Commission notes however that the right of access to court is not absolute and may be subject to legitimate limitations (Golder loc. cit.).  In Campbell and Fell (loc. cit. para. 113), the Court agreed with the Commission that ""there may well be security considerations which would justify some restriction on the conditions for visits by a lawyer to a prisoner"". The Commission recalls that in the present case the applicant had been sentenced to life imprisonment for murder and that, according to the Government's submissions, the applicant was a category A prisoner as well as on the SEP list while at the hospital.  The Commission notes that the police and prison officers were within very close proximity during the interview and that the applicant's solicitor in his letter of 14 November 1985 complained to the Chief Constable that they were compelled to conduct their conversation in hushed whispers to preserve some degree of confidentiality.  The Commission notes in this regard the problems of security inevitably caused by the presence of a prisoner of the applicant's classification in a public hospital.  The solicitor was however able to take photographs of the applicant's injuries for later use in litigation. Though his interview with the applicant was not facilitated by the close proximity of police and prison officers, the Commission notes that the applicant's stay in the hospital was of short duration (3-12 November) and that there is no indication that the applicant's solicitor could not have visited the applicant in prison, where secure visiting facilities would have enabled confidential consultations in the customary manner.  Furthermore the applicant has since instituted proceedings against the Secretary of State in relation to his injuries. Consequently, the Commission finds that the facts of this case fail to disclose any interference with the applicant's right of access to court as guaranteed by Article 6 para. 1 (Art. 6-1) of the Convention. It follows that this complaint is manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 27 para. 2 (Art. 27-2) of the Convention. 3.      The applicant complains that as a result of his application to the European Commission of Human Rights he has been placed in solitary confinement.  The Commission has examined this complaint in the context of Article 25 para. 1 (Art. 25-1) in fine of the Convention. The Commission recalls that following his arrival at Peterhead Prison the applicant was placed in a separate cell under Rule 36(1) of the Prison (Scotland) Rules 1952.  In his petition dated 24 June 1985, the applicant explained that he had opted for this regime in order that he could pursue various legal remedies and that this would not be possible in normal prison routine, where he would be required to work and to spend his evenings in the company of the other prisoners.  The Commission further recalls that in August 1985, the Assistant Governor sought to persuade the applicant to return to the normal prison routine but that the applicant again refused on the basis that he would not be able to study properly.  The matter was discussed again on 14 July 1986 when the applicant informed the Governor that if he were returned to normal conditions he would not expect to be employed in prison work but to continue with his ""appeal"" full-time.  When the applicant was told that this was not acceptable, he replied that he would prefer to remain on Rule 36 conditions. In light of the above circumstances, the Commission finds that the applicant was held on Rule 36 conditions at his own request to enable him to work full-time on possible legal remedies, including his application to the European Commission of Human Rights.  The applicant was approached several times by the prison authorities with a view to his returning to the ordinary prison regime but the applicant refused since he considered that he would be hampered in his case if was obliged to pursue it only in the evenings and weekends and in the presence of other prisoners.  While it appears that the applicant was discontented in that he could not have the benefit of removal from work under Rule 36 and continue to enjoy association with other prisoners outside working times, the Commission is satisfied that the applicant remained on Rule 36 conditions of his own volition.  The Commission further notes that the applicant is represented before the Commission by a solicitor and that there is no indication that the applicant has been hampered in the exercise of his right of individual petition.  The Commission therefore concludes that it need take no further action in respect of the alleged interference with the applicant's effective exercise of the right of individual petition within the meaning of Article 25 para. 1 (Art. 25-1) in fine. For these reasons, the Commission DECLARES THE REMAINDER OF THE APPLICATION INADMISSIBLE; DECIDES TO TAKE NO FURTHER ACTION in respect of the alleged interference with the effective exercise of the right of individual petition.

ROZAKIS Mrs.  J. LIDDY Mr.  J. RAYMOND, Deputy Secretary to the Commission. Having regard to Article 25 (Art. 25) of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms; Having regard to the application introduced on 4 August 1984 by Gandharv Raj CHAUHAN against the United Kingdom and registered on 3 May 1985 under file No. 11518/85; Having regard to: - the report provided for in Rule 40 of the Rules of Procedure of the Commission; - the written observations submitted by the respondent Government on 30 April 1987 on the admissibility and merits of the application; - the parties' oral submissions at the hearing before the Commission on 12 July 1988; - the Commission's decision of 1 December 1986 to communicate the application to the respondent Government under Rule 42 para. 2 (b); Having deliberated, Decides as follows: THE FACTS The applicant is a citizen of the United Kingdom born in 1938 and is an electrician by profession.  He resides in London.  He is represented in the proceedings before the Commission by Messrs.  Simons Muirhead and Burton, solicitors, London. The facts as agreed between the parties may be summarised as follows: The applicant had been employed as an electrician by the Ford Motor Company since 1978.  The company had, at that time, a union membership agreement which required an employee to be a member of a union.   The applicant had previously been a member of the Transport and General Workers' Union (TGWU) since 1976 but his membership had lapsed.  He then joined the Electrical, Electronics, Telecommunication and Plumbing Union (EETPU) as required by the union membership agreement at the beginning of his employment with the Ford Motor Company.  In April 1980 he allowed his membership of the EETPU to lapse by failing to keep up his subscriptions.  From that date he has not been a member of any trade union.  However, he continued to work for the Ford Motor Company and it was not until three years later, early in June 1983, that the fact of his lapsed union membership came to light. The applicant claimed that he was a devout orthodox Hindu belonging to the Radhaswami sect.  He explained that this sect divided its religious activities into four stages and that he had progressed to the third stage.  He considered that the religious teaching at this stage of his religion did not permit him to be a member of a trade union.  The applicant offered to pay to charity a sum equivalent to his union dues. The applicant was subsequently invited by the Employee Relations Manager to appeal to an independent panel, as provided for under the union membership agreement, in order to explain the reasons for his refusal.  He subsequently refused to have recourse to this appeal procedure since he considered that the panel could not be regarded as independent so long as any member of a trade union was represented upon it. The applicant was subsequently dismissed from his employment on 21 October 1983. The applicant then filed an application before the Industrial Tribunal.  He complained that his dismissal was unfair since he had genuine objections on grounds of conscience justifying his refusal to join a trade union in accordance with Section 58 (4) of the Employment Protection (Consolidation) Act 1978 (as amended). On 23 January 1984 the Industrial Tribunal rejected the applicant's case, finding that he had not proved a genuine and conscientious objection.  Accordingly, his dismissal was fair under the 1978 Act (as amended).  The Tribunal was satisfied that the Employee Relations Manager had explored the applicant's stated religious objections to trade union membership and that he was entitled to conclude that the applicant did not have a genuine conscientious objection. The Tribunal added: ""In order to make a judgment on a man's beliefs and motivations, it is necessary to take account of his actions as well as his words.  For our own part, we find it extremely hard to reconcile the applicant's three-year silence with his protestations of conscience."" The applicant appealed against this decision to the Employment Appeals Tribunal.  This appeal was rejected on 17 December 1984. The applicant was advised by his lawyers that an appeal to the Court of Appeal against this decision offered no prospects of success and would involve him in substantial expense. Relevant Domestic law and practice The Employment Protection (Consolidation) Act 1978 consolidated the unfair dismissal provisions of previous legislation, notably the Trade Union and Labour Relations Act 1974, the Employment Protection Act 1975 and the Trade Union and Labour Relations (Amendment) Act 1976.  Under this legislation dismissal for not being a trade union member was to be regarded as fair save where the employee genuinely objected on grounds of religious belief to being a member of a trade union. The Employment Act 1980 provided greater protection for employees who refused to join a trade union.  Dismissal was to be regarded as unfair for: (a)  employees who genuinely objected on grounds of conscience or other deeply-held personal conviction to being members of any trade union whatsoever or of a particular union; (b)  employees who belonged to the class of employee covered by the closed shop agreement before it took effect and who had at no time subsequently been members of a trade union in accordance with the agreement; (c)  employees working under a closed shop agreement brought into effect after 14 August 1980, but not approved by at least 80% of the emmployees covered by the agreement voting in favour of the agreement in secret ballot; (d)  employees working under a closed shop agreement brought into effect after 14 August 1980 which had been approved by at least 80% of those employees covered by it in a secret ballot in which the employee was entitled to vote if the employee had not at any time since the day on which the ballot was held been a member of the union. In addition, a Code of Practice was issued with the authority of Parliament and came into effect on 17 December 1980 (subsequently revised in May 1983).  It recommended, inter alia, that closed shop agreements should protect basic individual rights, and be applied flexibly and tolerantly and with due regard to the interests of individuals as well as unions and employers.  The Code is admissible in evidence, but imposes no legal obligations. The Employment Act 1982 further increased the protection of union employees working in the closed shop as well as re-enacting the closed shop dismissal provisions of the 1980 Act.  In particular, the 1982 Act provides that the dismissal of an employee for not being a member of a trade union, or for refusing to join one, is automatically unfair where the closed shop concerned is not ""approved"".  Up to 31 October 1984 any closed shop agreement which took effect on or before 14 August 1980 counted as ""approved"".  A closed shop agreement which took effect after 14 August 1980 only counts as ""approved"" if it has been supported in a secret ballot of all employees affected in which 80% or more of those entitled to vote voted in its favour. These were the provisions enforced when the applicant was dismissed on 21 October 1983. Since 1 November 1984 a closed shop agreement counts as ""approved"" on a given date only if in the five years preceding that date it has been supported in a secret ballot involving all the employees affected.  The required levels of support in the ballot are set out in the 1982 Act. Where a closed shop agreement is ""approved"" dismissal for non- membership of a trade union is not automatically fair.  The dismissal of certain categories of employee for not being members of a trade union, or for refusing to join one, remains unfair even where the closed shop agreement is an ""approved"" one.  The protected categories are as follows: (a) employees who genuinely object on grounds of conscience or other deeply-held personal conviction to being members of any trade union whatsoever or of a particular union; (b) employees who belonged to the class of employees covered by the closed shop agreement before it took effect and who have at no time subsequently been members of a trade union in accordance with the agreement; (c) employees who work under an ""approved"" closed shop agreement which took effect after 14 August 1980, were entitled to vote in the first or only ballot through which the closed shop agreement was approved, and have not since the day when that ballot was held been members of a trade union in accordance with the agreement; (d) employees who at the time of dismissal either had been found by an industrial tribunal to have been unreasonably excluded or expelled from the trade union of which membership was required under the closed shop agreement or who have a complaint of unreasonable exclusion or expulsion by that union lodged with an industrial tribunal under section 4 of the 1980 Act; (e) employees who have qualifications relating to their job which make them subject to a written code of conduct and either have been expelled from the trade union of which membership is required because they refused to strike or take other industrial action on the grounds that this would have breached the code of conduct; or have refused to belong to the union concerned on the grounds that membership would have required them to take industrial action in breach of the code. If an employee is unfairly dismissed from either an ""approved"" or an ""unapproved"" closed shop for not being a member of a trade union, or for refusing to join one, an industrial tribunal can order the employer to re-employ the employee concerned where this is practicable or to pay him compensation.  As a result of the 1982 Act, compensation in such cases has been set at substantially higher levels than in most other cases of unfair dismissal so as to act as a deterrent. COMPLAINTS The applicant complains that the dismissal from his employment was due exclusively to his refusal to join a trade union because of his religious objections.  He alleges that his dismissal was in breach of Article 11 para. 1 (Art. 11-1) of the Convention. PROCEEDINGS BEFORE THE COMMISSION The application was introduced on 4 August 1984 and registered on 3 May 1985.  In a decision dated 1 December 1986 the Commission decided that notice should be given to the respondent Government of the application and that the Government should be invited to submit observations on the admissibility and merits of the application insofar as it raised issues under Article 11 (Art. 11) of the Convention. These observations were submitted on 30 April 1987.  The applicant's observations in reply were received on 17 November 1987.  The applicant was granted legal aid by decision of the President of the Commission dated 20 August 1987. The Commission next considered the application on 8 March 1988 and decided to invite the parties to a joint hearing on the admissibility and merits of the case insofar as it raised issues under Articles 9, 11 and 14 (Art. 9,  Art. 11, Art. 14) of the Convention. The hearing before the Commission was held on 12 July 1988. The Parties were represented as follows: Respondent Government Mr.  M. C. Wood, Foreign and Commonwealth Office, Agent Mr.  N. Bratza Q.C., Counsel Mr.  R. Baker, Department of Employment, Adviser Mr.  R. Timm, Department of Employment, Adviser Applicant Mr.  G. Robertson, Q.C., Counsel Mr.  B. Simons         ) ) Solicitors, Simons, Muirhead & Burton Mr.  R. Mireskandari   ) SUBMISSIONS OF THE PARTIES The respondent Government Article 11 in conjunction with Article 9 (Art. 11 + Art. 9) of the Convention In the Government's submission where the complaint made is not of direct interference by the State of the rights guaranteed by the Convention but of a failure through its legal system to secure the right against interference by the action of others, the Convention requires the striking of a balance between the competing interests of the individual and of society as a whole.  A search for this balance is inherent in the whole of the Convention (Eur. Court H.R., Sporrong and Lönnroth judgment of 22 September 1980, Series A no. 52, para. 69). In marked contrast to the position of the applicants in the case of Young, James and Webster (Eur.  Court H.R., judgment of 13 August 1981, Series A no. 44) the union membership, or closed shop, agreement within the Ford Motor Company was in full effect at the time when the applicant joined that firm.  It is also clear that, for a period of over two years, the applicant in fact belonged to a trade union, first the TGWU and thereafter the EETPU. Quite apart from the personal position of the applicant, the applicable law at the time of the present applicant's dismissal was substantially different from that which was in effect at the time of the dismissal of the applicants in the case of Young, James and Webster and which was found by the Court to provide inadequate protection for the rights and freedoms guaranteed by Article 11 (Art. 11) of the Convention.  In the submission of the Government, the provisions of the 1980 and 1982 Acts, designed as they were to increase the protection afforded to individual employees against dismissal for refusing to join a union, strike a fair balance between the rights of the individual and the right of other employees to organise through the closed shop system.  In contrast to the position under the 1974 and 1976 Acts, which were the subject of the Court's judgment in the case of Young, James and Webster, it is submitted that the form of compulsion which is permitted under the 1982 Act and to which the applicant was subjected does not strike at the very substance of the freedom guaranteed by Article 11 para. 1 (Art. 11-1) read on its own or in the light of Articles 9 and 10 (Art. 9, Art. 10) of the Convention and did not give rise to a breach of that Article in the circumstances of his case. The Government further contest that Article 11 (Art. 11) confers a negative right.  The Court in the Young, James and Webster case expressly proceeded on the assumption that the negative aspect was not protected on the same footing as the positive aspect and that compulsion to join a particular union was not automatically contrary to this provision.  The Court emphasised in that case that the dismissal stemmed from a closed shop agreement which was concluded after the three applicants were employed by British Rail.  Such compulsion was imposed on the applicants unilaterally and was not a condition of their employment when they first applied for the job. In the present case the applicant accepted the requirement that he join a union as a condition of his employment by Ford Motor Company from the outset.  This was an essential part of his contract of employment which he accepted voluntarily. Moreover the applicant had an opportunity to submit his case to an internal tribunal which could have granted him an exception on the basis of his religious views.  However the applicant withdrew his appeal because he objected to the presence of a union member.  The Government do not accept that the presence of a union member in a tribunal of three persons, with an independent chairman, is a good reason for abandoning such an appeal. Before the Industrial Tribunal the applicant sought to invoke the provisions of Section 58 (4) of the 1978 Act (as amended) submitting that he had genuine objections to union membership on the grounds of conscience or other deeply-held personal convictions.  The applicant was represented by counsel before the Tribunal and it was open to him to support his case by both written and oral evidence.  In the result, the Tribunal concluded from the material before them that the applicant had not established that he had any genuine objection to union membership on grounds of conscience or other deeply-held personal conviction.  In so holding, the Tribunal placed particular reliance on the fact that the applicant had not asserted any objections to union membership until challenged some three years after he had allowed his membership to lapse. In reviewing the decisions of the Industrial Tribunal and the Employment Appeal Tribunal the Commission should limit itself to the question whether such a determination was unfair, perverse, arbitrary or otherwise a denial of the applicants rights (see, mutatis mutandis, No 8378/78, Dec of 14.5.80, D.R. 20 p. 168).  However, in his application to the Commission, no complaint is made that the applicant was given an unfair hearing before either the Industrial Tribunal or the Employment Appeal Tribunal or that the decision reached by either of the Tribunals was arbitrary.  Nor is it suggested that the decisions resulted from a misinterpretation or misapplication of Section 58 (4) of the 1978 Act (as amended) or that no Tribunal properly directing itself could reasonably have concluded that the applicant had no genuine objections to union membership on grounds of conscience or other deeply-held personal convictions. The Government submit that in such circumstances neither the relevant provisions of domestic law nor the application of those provisions by the domestic tribunals upset the fair balance required by Article 11 para. 1 (Art. 11-1) of the Convention. Article 14 (Art. 14) of the Convention The Government submit that the applicant was given exactly the same treatment as other persons including members of other religions in a comparable situation.  Neither the statutory provisions in force nor the Industrial Tribunal or Employment Appeal Tribunal treated the applicant in any way unfairly or less favourably than an applicant of a different religious persuasion.  This complaint should therefore be rejected as manifestly ill-founded. The Applicant Article 11 in conjunction with Article 9 (Art. 11 + Art. 9) of the Convention The present application is made on the basis that United Kingdom domestic law and practice does not afford the applicant protection of his rights and freedoms under Article 11 in conjunction with Article 9 (Art. 11 + Art. 9) of the Convention.  In particular, protection against unfair dismissal does not extend to a situation where: (1) the applicant is a devout orthodox Hindu; (2) the applicant refuses to join a trade union. The applicant points out that if the union membership agreement at his place of work had come into effect after 14 August 1980 he would have had the opportunity to vote on its application and, moreover, would have been protected from unfair dismissal on the ground of non-membership if he had not been a member of a trade union since the required ballot.  The applicant submits that in making this provision the United Kingdom has impliedly recognised that the legal position for union membership agreements made before 14 August 1980 is in breach of the principle of freedom of association.  Since the union membership agreement at the applicant's former place of work came into effect before 14 August 1980 he has been denied the opportunity of wider protection from dismissal on the grounds of non-membership of a trade union. The applicant states that, although he knew the existence of, and understood the provisions of, the union membership agreement when he accepted employment with the Ford Motor Company, this cannot be taken to imply that he either agreed with it, or that, by taking up employment, he thereby waived any right to leave the union and seek protection from dismissal at a later date. As regards questions of fact, the applicant makes the following points: -       that in his application to the Commission the applicant stated that when he began his employment he joined the union under duress as there was no legislation prevailing at that time which protected those who did not wish to be a member of a trade union; -       that there was at no time any legislative provision which required him to articulate his conscientious objections to union membership either when the membership lapsed in April 1980 or in the period up until June 1983; -       that the religious involvement of the applicant became more intense between the years 1978 to 1983.  The fact that the applicant remained a union member for two years from 1978 until 1980 does not imply that he acquiesced to union membership since the consequences of renouncing his membership were likely to involve his dismissal.  At the time of seeking employment in March 1978 his religious beliefs made him reluctant to join a trade union but they were not so strong as to amount to an overriding conscientious objection to membership. However by April 1980 he had progressed to a higher stage in his religious feeling and believed that his religious views were utterly incompatible with trade union membership.  These views stressed non-violence, commitment to truth and freedom from any form of extra-legal compulsion.  The applicant thus considered himself under an absolute duty never to be associated with any false statement through membership of a group or to be associated with any group that espouses violent actions and, finally, not to be a party to duress over others or to allow himself to be the victim of compulsion; -       that the reason the applicant withdrew his appeal to the independent panel was on the grounds that the panel could not be regarded as independent since it included a trade union representative.  Where a member is being judged by a trade union member there must be a reasonable fear of bias when one is submitting that trade union membership may involve departure from the truth and association with acts of violence; -       the applicant remained silent about his decision to leave the union because this was an action taken from private beliefs and because he would have suffered immediate victimisation and job loss. The applicant submits that the failure on the part of the United Kingdom to protect the applicant against dismissal on the grounds of his refusal to join a trade union is a breach of Article 11 para. 1 (Art. 11-1) of the Convention.  Article 11 (Art. 11) confers a negative right not to join a trade union even where a union membership agreement is in force.  The freedom to form or join a trade union does not mean that one is obliged to do so.  Only that one is permitted to do so. Accordingly, the freedom to join a trade union must encompass a freedom not to join.  A person cannot be free to do something unless he or she is free not to do it.  Since freedom presupposes an element of choice, a regime of compulsion is incompatible with the very idea of freedom.  The closed shop as applied in the circumstances of the applicant's case afforded him no real choice whether to join a union or not, since his only other option entailed a loss of livelihood. In this connection, the tenor of the judgment of the Court in the case of Young, James and Webster favours such a negative freedom. Thus the majority stated that ""the situation facing the applicants clearly runs counter to the concept of freedom of association in its negative sense ..."" (loc. cit., para. 55).  Moreover, the majority reasoned that a threat of dismissal (including loss of livelihood) is a ""most serious form of compulsion - striking at the very substance of the freedom guaranteed by Article 11 (Art. 11)"" (loc. cit., para. 57). Such reasoning would make little sense if it was not based on a presupposition that Article 11 (Art. 11) protects non-membership as well as membership of a union or other association.  The compulsion suffered by the applicant involved a threat to extinguish his livelihood at a time of high unemployment.  In reality, the situation of the applicant was the same as that faced by the applicants Young, James and Webster. The Court in Young, James and Webster also put much emphasis on the concept of freedom of choice.  In particular it held that: ""An individual does not enjoy the right of freedom of association if in reality the freeedom of action or choice which remains available to him is either non-existent or so reduced as to be of no practical value"" (loc. cit., para. 56). It is submitted that the applicant's choice, because of his religious beliefs and because of the nature of the union membership agreement, was so reduced as to be of no practical value.  This choice was further reduced by the fact that the only alternative open to the applicant involved loss of livelihood.  The applicant accepts that under present United Kingdom law protection is afforded to persons not wishing to be members of a trade union if, inter alia, their objection is based on conscience or other deeply held personal conviction.  However, protection under present legislation does not extend to the situation in which the applicant finds himself, namely an Orthodox Hindu who refuses to be in a trade union. In respect of the respondent Government's submission that the applicant should be regarded as having consented to join the union since he was aware that this was a term of his contract of employment, the applicant points out that the Court has indicated in the Young James and Webster case that there might be compulsion even in this situation (loc. cit., para. 53).  Furthermore the applicant joined the union under duress in a situation where there was limited statutory protection for persons not wishing to join trade unions. Since the right not to join a trade union has been recognised the right to leave a union, after the contract of employment is made without the consequent loss of a job, must follow.  If the principle of freedom of association is infringed by dismissal from employment on the grounds of non-membership of a union it can make no logical difference whether the union membership agreement on which dismissals are based was concluded before or after the contract.  The mere fact that someone has exercised his right of association does not mean that he should forever be bound by it. The applicant contends that the ""balancing"" approach proposed by the respondent Government is erroneous.  Once there is an infringement of Article 11 para. 1 (Art. 11-1) there is no longer any balance to be struck between competing interests.  Unless the Government can bring themselves within the narrowly interpreted exceptions in Article 11 para. 2 (Art.11-2) - which has not been argued in this case - the applicant must succeed. As regards Article 11 in conjunction with Article 9 (Art.11 + Art. 9) the applicant submits firstly that the requirement that he join a trade union irrespective of any religious beliefs he might hold constitutes a breach of these provisions read together.  A rule that obliges an individual to act contrary to the teachings of his religion amounts to an infringement of religious freedom. Secondly Article 9 (Art. 9) of the Convention extends to the freedom to change belief.  The applicant changed his belief when he progressed to a higher stage of his faith.  It was for this reason that he allowed his membership to lapse in 1980.  The applicant submits, in this respect, that a system which allows his dismissal for leaving a trade union unless he can discharge the burden of proving his religious convictions is in breach of these provisions.  It is a violation of religious freedom to be required, on pain of having the dismissal upheld, to prove the genuineness of ones private religious views particularly if one is a member of a little-understood religious sect which imposes higher duties in the course of religious advancement. Furthermore it is incompatible with the protection of intimate spiritual beliefs under Article 9 (Art. 9) that an individual should be required to expose elders of his sect or church to cross-examination in public about innermost religious feelings, with the risk of being held up to ridicule, as a pre-condition of protecting his freedom of association. The applicant submits that, after providing an indication of membership of his religion and of the contents of his religious belief in the form of the Ordinances of Manu, the burden of proving that the belief is not a genuine one ought to have been borne by the employer. In the circumstances of the case it is submitted that the law with regard to unfair dismissal and its application by domestic tribunals in the present case breached Article 11 (Art. 11) of the Convention, considered alone or in conjunction with Article 9 (Art. 9) of the Convention. Article 14 (Art. 14) of the Convention The applicant further submits that he has suffered discrimination in the enjoyment of his rights under Articles 9 and 11 (Art. 9, Art. 11) contrary to Article 14 (Art. 14) of the Convention. Those who hold religious opinions which preclude them from joining trade unions are placed under two discriminatory burdens. First they are subjected to duress and pressure to compromise their religious faith.  Secondly those who are members of little-understood religious faiths, such as the applicant, bear a much heavier burden of explanation and proof of their creed than members of more traditional religions whose views are well understood by tribunals. THE LAW The applicant, who was dismissed from his employment because of his refusal to rejoin a trade union, submits that union membership was incompatible with his deeply-held religious beliefs.  He complains under Articles 9, 11 and 14 (Art. 9, Art. 11, Art. 14) of the Convention. Article 11 para. 1 (Art. 11-1) of the Convention reads as follows: ""1.   Everyone has the right to freedom of peaceful assembly and to freedom of association with others, including the right to form and join trade unions for the protection of his interests."" Article 9 para. 1 (Art. 9-1) of the Convention reads as follows: ""1.  Everyone has the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion;  this right includes freedom to change his religion or belief and freedom, either alone or in community with others and in public or private, to manifest his religion or belief, in worship, teaching, practice and observance."" Article 14 (Art. 14) of the Convention reads as follows: ""The enjoyment of the rights and freedoms set forth in this Convention shall be secured without discrimination on any ground such as sex, race, colour, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, association with a national minority, property, birth or other status."" The applicant first submits that Article 11 para. 1 (Art. 11-1) contains a general negative right to choose not to be a member of a trade union. He points out that although he knew of the existence of a union membership agreement when he accepted employment with the Ford Motor Company, this cannot be taken to apply that he either agreed with it, or that, by taking up employment, he thereby waived any right to leave the union subsequently.  He further complains of a breach of Article 11 read in conjunction with Article 9 (Art. 11 + Art. 9) since the requirement to join a trade union is incompatible with his religious beliefs.  The applicant explains that he is a devote orthodox Hindu who belongs to the Radhaswami sect and whose religious beliefs had progressed to a higher stage when he allowed his union membership to lapse in 1980.  These religious beliefs involved a rejection of the use of violence, a deep attachment to the truth and freedom from duress.  In particular, he complains that the requirement under the law of the United Kingdom, that he should prove the genuineness of his private religious beliefs and expose the elders of his sect to public cross-examination concerning the intimate details of his creed, constitutes a breach of Articles 9 and 11 (Art. 9, Art. 11) of the Convention read together. Finally, the applicant complains that he was a victim of discrimination in the enjoyment of his rights under Articles 9 and 11 (Art. 9, Art. 11) of the Convention in that firstly he was required to join a union irrespective of his religious beliefs and that he was required to bear a heavier burden of proof before the Industrial Tribunal than other more traditional faiths. The respondent Government submit that the applicant accepted voluntarily to join a trade union on taking up employment with the Ford Motor Company.  They also point out that the applicant was given full opportunity to establish the genuineness of his beliefs and was represented by counsel both before the Industrial Tribunal and the Employment Appeal Tribunal.  These bodies concluded on the basis of the evidence before them that the applicant had not established that he had any genuine objection to union membership on grounds of conscience or other deeply held personal convictions.  There is no indication that these decisions were perverse or arbitrary or otherwise a denial of the applicant's rights under the Convention. The Government contend, with reference to the case of Young, James and Webster (Eur.  Court H.R., judgment of 13 August 1981, Series A no. 44), that Article 11 (Art. 11) does not guarantee a general negative freedom not to belong to a trade union.  Finally, the Government maintain that the applicant has not substantiated his complaint of discrimination and was treated in the same way as a member of any other religion in a comparable situation. The Commission considers, in the light of the parties' submissions, that the application as a whole raises complex issues of law and fact under the Convention, the determination of which depend on an examination of the merits of the application. It concludes, therefore, that the application cannot be regarded as manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 27 para. 2 (Art. 27-2) of the Convention and no other ground for declaring it inadmissible has been established. For these reasons, the Commission DECLARES THE APPLICATION ADMISSIBLE without prejudging the merits of the case Deputy Secretary to the Commission         President of the Commission (J.

KRÜGER Secretary to the Commission Having regard to Article 25 (Art. 25) of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms; Having regard to the application introduced on 5 June 1985 by Stig NISSEN against Sweden and registered on 19 August 1985 under file No. 11707/85; Having regard to the report provided for in Rule 40 of the Rules of Procedure of the Commission; Having deliberated; Decides as follows: THE FACTS The facts, as submitted by the applicant, may be summarised as follows. The applicant is a Swedish national, born in 1946 and resident at Vintrie.  He is a taxi owner and member of ROYSTAXI Economic Association.  Before the Commission the applicant is represented by Mr. Göran Ravnsborg, a university lecturer at Lund. According to Chapter 2 Section 1 of the 1979 Act on Commercial Transportation (yrkestrafiklagen) commercial transportation of passengers may only be conducted on the condition that a licence has been granted.  A licence to run a taxi business is issued by the County Administrative Board (länsstyrelsen) and is limited to a specific transportation zone.  The licence-holder is allowed to operate everywhere in or outside his transportation zone on orders received within this zone.  Outside the zone he is allowed only to accept orders which involve taking the passenger back to, or in the direction back, to his transportation zone.  He is obliged to bring the vehicle back to his transportation zone as soon as possible. Exceptions to this rule, which is laid down in Chapter 4 Section 7 of the 1979 Ordinance on Commercial Transportation (yrkestrafikförordningen), may be granted by the County Administrative Board if it is needed in order to satisfy a temporary need for transportation of passengers. The Act and the Ordinance entered into force on 1 January 1980. Before that date commercial transportation was regulated by the 1940 Royal Decree on Commercial Automobile Traffic.  The Decree contained provisions concerning commercial transportation of passengers similar to those mentioned above, one difference being that the County Administrative Board could issue exemptions from the provisions of the Decree valid for a long period of time or until further notice. In the Malmö transportation zone there are about 220 licences. ROYSTAXI has four of these and the members of Malmö Taxi Economic Association (MTEA) have the remaining licences. As a result of the opening of Sturup International Airport, situated outside the Malmö transportation zone, the County Administrative Board of Malmöhus County decided on 24 November 1972 that as from 1 December 1972 and until further notice MTEA, at that time the only transport organisation in Malmö, as well as each member of MTEA, were exempted from the provisions of the then applicable 1940 Decree.  Accordingly, taxi drivers of MTEA were able to operate freely from Sturup Airport.  On 28 June 1973 the County Administrative Board granted MTEA continued exemption, until further notice, from the said rule. In the summer of 1981 the applicant together with some other taxi owners founded a new taxi organisation, the ROYSTAXI Economic Association.  The applicant resigned from MTEA on 31 December 1981, but some of the others upheld membership in both associations. The question arose in 1981 whether there was still a valid exemption for MTEA and its members to operate freely from Sturup International Airport, since the Decree, which allowed long term exemptions, was no longer in force.  The County Administrative Board, in a letter of 24 April 1981, informed Mr.  Roy Gasper, member of ROYSTAXI, that the exemption was still valid and that it did not include him since he was no longer a member of MTEA. The applicant, together with Mr.  Gasper and another member of ROYSTAXI, Mr.  Lars-Erik Hjelm, then requested that they be granted exemption from the provisions of Chapter 4 Section 7 of the Ordinance on Commercial Transportation until further notice so as to enable them to operate taxi traffic at Sturup Airport. On 9 March 1982 the County Administrative Board refused to grant the exemption requested.  The Board declared, with reference to the 1979 Ordinance, that it had competence to issue exemptions for temporary needs only and that there was no temporary need. In 1983 a joint stock company (Malmöhus läns taxiservice AB) was founded.  It was planned to have all the taxi economic associations within the Malmöhus County as its shareholders.  When negotiating with ROYSTAXI and MTEA on co-operation the company requested a permit for its associates to operate taxi traffic at Sturup Airport. On 5 October 1983 the County Administrative Board decided that all the licence-holders in the County, who through their association or in another way were joint owners of the company, could operate from the Sturup Airport taxi zone.  The same right was given to the licence-holders affiliated to the common dispatch exchange in the Malmö zone. The applicant did not subscribe to the common dispatch exchange, nor did Mr.  Gasper and Mr.  Hjelm, since only members of MTEA could subscribe to it. The three of them appealed to the Board of Transport (transportrådet) requesting that they be included in the decision on the taxi traffic at Sturup Airport, or alternatively, that all the licence-holders of the Malmö traffic zone be included.  The Board of Transport returned the appeal to the County Administrative Board since the requests of the applicant and his colleagues had not been dealt with by that Board.  On 2 March 1984 the County Administrative Board decided that the applicant as well as Mr.  Gasper and Mr.  Hjelm were entitled to operate in the Sturup Airport traffic zone. However, in the meantime, the applicant had been prosecuted for having, on 27 August, 2 October and 10 November 1982, operated transportation of passengers at Sturup Airport.  He was convicted for violation of the Ordinance on Commercial Transportation by the District Court (tingsrätten) of Trelleborg on 1 February 1984 and sentenced to a fine. The Court stated as follows in its reasons: ""It is established that Mr.  Nissen has permission to transport passengers within the Malmö municipality and that Mr.  Nissen has applied for permission to transport passengers from Sturup Airport and that the County Administrative Board of Malmöhus County on 9 March 1982 refused to grant the application. Mr.  Nissen has not disputed the facts but denied that he is criminally liable since there has been no criminal offence. He considers that he returned to Malmö as soon as possible after having terminated the transport order.  Being heard he has said:  On 27 August 1982 and on 10 November 1982 he had terminated a transport order at Sturup Airport and then queued up in the taxi queue to wait for passengers.  On both occasions he knew that airplanes would soon land.  On 2 October 1982 he had driven passengers to Svaneholm castle and on his way back to Malmö driven to Sturup Airport since he knew that an airplane would land at that time.  He waited with his car in the taxi queue for passengers. On the occasions at issue he has received and executed driving orders from Sturup Airport.  The orders were not booked in advance. At the request of the Public Prosecutor evidence has been given by Mr.  KF.  The evidence supports the information on the factual circumstances submitted by the Public Prosecutor. The District Court finds it established that Mr.  Nissen, on each occasion at issue, has violated through his actions the provision in Chapter 4 Section 7 of the Ordinance on Commercial Transportation.  The charge is therefore well- founded."" The conviction was upheld by the Court of Appeal (hovrätten) for Scania (Skåne) and Blekinge on 17 October 1984.  The applicant's appeal to the Supreme Court (högsta domstolen) was unsuccessful.  On 16 January 1985 the Supreme Court refused to grant leave to appeal. COMPLAINTS The applicant complains that he has been discriminated against as a result of the decision by the Public Prosecutor to institute criminal proceedings against him and his associates in ROYSTAXI and not against any of the members of MTEA.  The decision of the County Administrative Board of 28 June 1973 had become null and void by 1 January 1980, due to the fact that the 1979 Ordinance, that entered into force on that date, did not allow exemptions from its provisions for long periods or until further notice.  The applicant therefore considers that the operating of taxi traffic from Sturup Airport by MTEA was also illegal. The applicant further complains that the fact that he was prosecuted for having transported passengers in violation of the 1979 Ordinance, whereas the officials of the County Administrative Board who in other respects had violated Swedish law and the Ordinance were not prosecuted, constitutes a discrimination against him.  The applicant complains that this is a violation of his right to negative freedom of association.  He invokes Articles 11 and 14 (Art. 11, Art. 14) of the Convention. THE LAW The applicant complains of being a victim of discrimination, in that he and his associates in ROYSTAXI and no one from MTEA were prosecuted and convicted for offences allegedly committed by the taxi owners, who were members of MTEA, since the licences granted to MTEA members were illegal.  He also complains of being the victim of discrimination as he was prosecuted for having committed offences under the 1979 Ordinance, while the officials of the County Administrative Board were not prosecuted, although they had violated the Ordinance in other respects.  The applicant submits that he has also, as a result of the prosecution and conviction, been a victim of a breach of his right to negative freedom of association.  He invokes Articles 11 and 14 (Art. 11, Art. 14) of the Convention. The Commission notes that the applicant's complaint is primarily directed against his prosecution and subsequent conviction by the District Court as upheld by the Court of Appeal and finally by the Supreme Court on 16 January 1985.  The Commission observes that the Swedish courts, which convicted the applicant for violation of the Ordinance on Commercial Transportation, had no competence to decide on anything but the criminal charge against the applicant.  They were not competent to pronounce any opinion on whether other persons had committed similar offences, whether the applicant ought to have been granted a licence to operate at Sturup Airport or whether he had been discriminated against as a result of the granting of licences to other taxi drivers or in any other respect. The Commission here recalls that there is no right under the Convention to have criminal proceedings instituted by the State against other persons. The Commission notes that the applicant's conviction was based on the fact that he did not have the requisite licence to operate traffic at Sturup Airport.  There is no indication that the prosecution and conviction of the applicant for having illegally operated taxi traffic at Sturup Airport were as such based on his membership in ROYSTAXI or on his not being a member of MTEA.  The applicant's complaint of discrimination against him as compared to the officials of the County Administrative Board is wholly unfounded. The applicant's allegation that Swedish law has been violated by granting the exemption to MTEA members is unsubstantiated. Accordingly, there is no appearance of a violation of the applicant's right to freedom of association under Article 11 (Art. 11) or of the prohibition of discrimination in Article 14 (Art. 14) of the Convention. It follows that the application is manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 27 para. 2 (Art. 27-2) of the Convention.

KRÜGER, Secretary to the Commission Having regard to Article 25 (Art. 25) of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms; Having regard to the application introduced on 1 October 1987 by P. against the United Kingdom and registered on 22 October 1987 under file No. 13473/87; Having regard to the report provided for in Rule 40 of the Rules of Procedure of the Commission; Having deliberated; Decides as follows: THE FACTS The applicant is a British citizen born in 1942 and resident in Glasgow.  He is represented by Fergus S. Ewing, a solicitor practising in Scotland.  The facts as submitted by the applicant may be summarised as follows. The applicant owns and occupies his home, a detached villa, in Glasgow, Scotland.  As occupier, the applicant is responsible for paying rates to the local authority in respect of this property.  The applicant also owns business premises in B., for which he must also pay rates.  Following the revaluation of the rateable value of his properties in 1985 and an increase of the rates due, the applicant entered a valuation appeal complaining, inter alia, that similar properties in England were charged considerably less in rates. From the precognition of the chartered surveyor who acted as expert witness in the proceedings, it does not appear that there was any dispute as to the method of assessment or as to whether it was in accordance with statutory provisions. However, while in Scotland a revaluation had taken place in 1985, none had been carried out in England and Wales since 1973 and the surveyor stated that this was the major if not sole cause of the disparity complained of by the applicant.  The appeal was heard before the Strathclyde Region Local Valuation Panel on 2 April 1987 and the applicant was informed by letter dated 7 April 1987 that the Panel found sufficient and adequate evidence as to similar property in the Strathclyde region to justify the valuation and that in these circumstances it was not entitled to look at property outside Scotland for purposes of comparison.  The applicant was precluded from appealing against this decision by S.15 of the Local Government Financial Provisions (Scotland) Act 1963 as amended by S.19 of the Rating and Valuation Amendment (Scotland) Act 1984. The valuation of rates in this case was carried out pursuant to the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1975 as amended by the Rating and Valuation (Amendment) (Scotland) Act 1984, which provide for the implementation of a rating system in Scotland, which though in most essentials similar to the rating system in England and Wales, does differ in procedural matters.  For example, revaluations take place automatically in Scotland unless revoked by the Secretary of State, whereas in England a revaluation has to be commissioned by the Secretary of State.  Also in Scotland, revaluations are carried out by the Assessor, while in England, they are carried out by the Inland Revenue. COMPLAINTS While the rates levied in respect of his properties are not unrepresentative of similar property in the Strathclyde region, the applicant complains that since the revaluation in 1985 the level of rates payable is greater than for a comparable property situated in England by 25 - 250 %.  The applicant complains that this difference of treatment of business and ordinary ratepayers in Scotland constitutes discrimination against a national minority.  The applicant invokes Article 14 (Art. 14) of the Convention read in conjunction with Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (P1-1) to the Convention. THE LAW The applicant complains that as the owner of a home and of business premises in Scotland, he is liable to heavier rates than those payable in respect of similar properties in England.  He invokes Article 14 (Art. 14) of the Convention read in conjunction with Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (P1-1) to the Convention. Article 14 (Art. 14) of the Convention provides that: ""The enjoyment of the rights and freedoms set forth in this Convention shall be secured without discrimination on any ground such as sex, race, colour, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, association with a national minority, property, birth or other status."" Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (P1-1) provides that: ""Every natural or legal person is entitled to the peaceful enjoyment of his possessions.  No one shall be deprived of his possessions except in the public interest and subject to the conditions provided for by law and by the general principles of international law. The preceding provisions shall not, however, in any way impair the right of a State to enforce such laws as it deems necessary to control the use of property in accordance with the general interest or to secure the payment of taxes or other contributions or penalties."" The Commission recalls that Article 14 (Art. 14) of the Convention protects the enjoyment of rights and freedoms guaranteed under the Convention from discrimination ""on any ground such as sex, race colour, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, association with a national minority, property, birth or other status.""  The applicant complains of a difference in the level of rates payable between two regional jurisdictions within the United Kingdom and alleges that this is discrimination against a national minority. The Commission notes in this regard that in many, if not all, of the Contracting States, different legal jurisdictions exist in different geographical areas within the State (e.g. cantons, communes, Länder, etc).  The Commission considers that Article 14 (Art. 14) does not require a state to operate a uniform system of rate valuation throughout its national territory.  Thus the mere existence of variations between such jurisdictions within a State does not constitute discrimination within the meaning of Article 14 (Art. 14) of the Convention.  Moreover, there is no indication that the impact since 1985 on the applicant's properties of the differentiation between England and Scotland as concerns the frequency of revaluation of the rates in force was based on ""association with a national minority"" or on any other ground mentioned in Article 14 (Art. 14).  The Commission accordingly finds no appearance of a violation of Article 14 of the Convention in conjunction with Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (Art. 14+P1-1). It follows that this application is manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 27 para. 2 (Art. 27-2) of the Convention. For these reasons, the Commission DECLARES THE APPLICATION INADMISSIBLE. Secretary to the Commission        President of the Commission (H.C. KRÜGER)                    (C.A. NØRGAARD)",,

THUNE Sir  Basil HALL MM.  F. MARTINEZ C. L. ROZAKIS Mrs.  J. LIDDY Mr.  H.C. KRÜGER Secretary to the Commission Having regard to Article 25 (Art. 25) of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms; Having regard to the application introduced on 9 June 1986 by Roy GASPER and Lars-Erik HJELM against Sweden and registered on 1 December 1986 under file No. 12576/86; Having regard to the report provided for in Rule 40 of the Rules of Procedure of the Commission; Having deliberated; Decides as follows: THE FACTS The facts, as submitted by the applicants, may be summarised as follows. The first applicant, Mr.  Gasper, was born in 1940 and is resident at Åkarp.  The second applicant, Mr.  Hjelm, was born in 1935 and is resident at Malmö.  Both applicants are Swedish citizens.  They are taxi owners and members of the ROYSTAXI Economic Association. Before the Commission the applicants are represented by Mr.  Göran Ravnsborg, a university lecturer at Lund. According to Chapter 2 Section 1 of the 1979 Act on Commercial Transportation (yrkestrafiklagen) commercial transportation of passengers may only be conducted on the condition that a licence has been granted.  A licence to run a taxi business is issued by the County Administrative Board (länsstyrelsen) and is limited to a specific transportation zone.  The licence-holder is allowed to operate everywhere in or outside his transportation zone on orders received within this zone.  Outside the zone he is allowed only to accept orders which involve taking the passenger back to, or in the direction back to, his transportation zone.  He is obliged to bring the vehicle back to his transportation zone as soon as possible. Exceptions to this rule, which is laid down in Chapter 4 Section 7 of the 1979 Ordinance on Commercial Transportation (yrkestrafikförordningen), may be granted by the County Administrative Board if it is needed in order to satisfy a temporary need for transportation of passengers. The Act and the Ordinance entered into force on 1 January 1980.  Before that date commercial transportation was regulated by the 1940 Royal Decree on Commercial Automobile Traffic.  The Decree contained provisions concerning commercial transportation of passengers similar to those mentioned above, one difference being that the County Administrative Board could issue exemptions from the provisions of the Decree valid for a long period of time or until further notice. In the Malmö transportation zone there are about 220 licences. ROYSTAXI has four of these and the members of Malmö Taxi Economic Association (MTEA) have the remaining licences. As a result of the opening of Sturup International Airport, situated outside the Malmö transportation zone, the County Administrative Board of Malmöhus County decided on 24 November 1972 that as from 1 December 1972 and until further notice MTEA, at that time the only transport organisation in Malmö, as well as each member of MTEA, were exempted from the then applicable provisions in the 1940 Decree.  Accordingly, taxi drivers of MTEA were able to operate freely from Sturup Airport.  On 28 June 1973 the County Administrative Board granted MTEA continued exemption, until further notice, from the said rule. In the summer of 1981 the applicants together with some other taxi owners founded a new taxi organisation, the ROYSTAXI Economic Association.   The applicants resigned from MTEA on 31 December 1980 and 31 December 1981 respectively. The applicants together with another member of ROYSTAXI, Mr.  Stig Nissen, on 7 December 1981 requested that they be granted exemption from the provisions of Chapter 4 Section 7 of the Ordinance on Commercial Transportation until further notice so as to enable them to operate taxi traffic at Sturup Airport. On 9 March 1982 the County Administrative Board refused to grant the exemption requested.  The Board declared, with reference to the 1979 Ordinance, that it had competence to issue exemptions for temporary needs only and that there was no temporary need. In 1983 a joint stock company (Malmöhus läns taxiservice AB) was founded.  It was planned to have all the taxi economic associations within the Malmöhus County as its shareholders.  When negotiating with ROYSTAXI and MTEA on co-operation the company requested a permit for its associates to operate taxi traffic at Sturup Airport. On 5 October 1983 the County Administrative Board decided that all the licence-holders in the County, who through their association or in another way were joint owners of the company, could operate from Sturup Airport taxi zone.  The same right was given to the licence-holders affiliated to the common dispatch exchange in the Malmö zone. Mr.  Gasper and Mr.  Hjelm did not subscribe to the common dispatch exchange, nor did Mr.  Nissen, since only members of MTEA could subscribe to it. The three of them appealed to the Board of Transport (transportrådet) requesting that they be included in the decision on the taxi traffic at Sturup Airport or, alternatively, that all the licence-holders of the Malmö traffic zone be included.  The Board of Transport returned the appeal to the County Administrative Board since the requests of the applicants and Mr.  Nissen had not been dealt with by that Board.  On 2 March 1984 the County Administrative Board decided that the applicants as well as Mr.  Nissen were entitled to operate in the Sturup Airport traffic zone. However, in the meantime, the applicants had been prosecuted for having on 28 July 1982 and 2 October 1982 respectively operated transportation of passengers at Sturup International Airport.  They were convicted of violation of the Ordinance on Commercial Transportation by the District Court (tingsrätten) of Trelleborg on 10 October 1983 and sentenced to a fine. The convictions were upheld by the Court of Appeal (hovrätten) for Scania (Skåne) and Blekinge on 2 February 1984.  The applicants appealed unsuccessfully to the Supreme Court (högsta domstolen) which on 4 April 1986 refused to grant leave to appeal. COMPLAINTS The applicants complain that they have been discriminated against as a result of the decision by the Public Prosecutor to institute criminal proceedings against the applicants and their associates in ROYSTAXI and not against any of the members of MTEA. The decision of the County Administrative Board of 28 June 1973 had become null and void by 1 January 1980, due to the fact that the 1979 Ordinance, that entered into force on that date, did not allow exemptions from its provisions for long periods or until further notice.  The applicants consider that also the operating of taxi traffic from Sturup International Airport by MTEA was illegal. Alternatively, the applicants claim that they had a legal right to operate from Sturup International Airport at the time of the prosecution since the exemption granted by the County Administrative Board on 28 June 1973 was still valid for licence-holders irrespective of their resignation from MTEA. The applicants allege that the decisions complained of also violated their rights to negative freedom of association and that this violation caused discrimination and infringements of their rights to peaceful enjoyment of their possessions, since it became difficult for them to retain their passengers.  They also submit that the fine which was imposed on them violated their right to peaceful enjoyment of possessions. The applicants invoke Articles 11 and 14 (Art. 11, Art. 14) of the Convention and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (P1-1) to the Convention. THE LAW The applicants complain of being victims of discrimination, in that they and their associates in ROYSTAXI and no one from MTEA were prosecuted for and convicted of offences allegedly committed by the taxi owners, who were members of MTEA, since the licences granted to MTEA members were illegal.  The applicants submit that they have also as a result of the prosecution and conviction been victims of a breach of their right to negative freedom of association.  They invoke Articles 11 and 14 (Art. 11, Art. 14) of the Convention. The Commission notes that the applicants' complaints are directed against their prosecution and subsequent conviction by the District Court, as finally confirmed by the Supreme Court on 4 April 1986.  The Commission observes that the Swedish courts, which convicted the applicants of violation of the Ordinance on Commercial Transportation, had no competence to decide on anything but the criminal charge against the applicants.  They were not competent to pronounce any opinion on whether other persons had committed similar offences, whether the applicants ought to have been granted licences to operate at Sturup Airport or whether they had been discriminated against as a result of the granting of licences to other taxi drivers or in any other respect. The Commission recalls in this context that there is no right under the Convention to have criminal proceedings instituted by the State against other persons. The Commission notes that the conviction of the applicants was based on the fact that they did not have the requisite licence to operate traffic at Sturup Airport.  There is no indication that the prosecution and conviction of the applicants for having illegally operated taxi traffic at Sturup International Airport were as such based on their membership in ROYSTAXI or on their not being members of MTEA. The applicants' allegation that Swedish law has been violated by granting the exemption to MTEA members is unsubstantiated. Accordingly there is no appearance of a violation of the applicants' right to freedom of association under Article 11 (Art. 11) or of the prohibition of discrimination in Article 14 (Art. 14) of the Convention. The Commission finds no issue under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (P1-1) to the Convention. It follows that the application is manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 27 para. 2 (Art. 27-2) of the Convention.

Having deliberated; Decides as follows: THE FACTS The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows: The applicant, a Swiss citizen born in 1958, resides in Zurich.  Before the Commission she is represented by Messrs.  E. Schönenberger and K. Mäder, lawyers practising in Zurich. I.      Particular circumstances of the case In connection with criminal investigations aginst one Mr.  K. in Hamburg and one Mr.  B. in Zurich concerning procuring (Zuhälterei) and pandering (Kuppelei), the Zurich District Attorney's Office (Bezirksanwaltschaft) issued an order against the applicant to appear on 8 August 1983 as witness (Vorführungsbefehl).  The order was signed by the District Attorney D.J. On 11 August 1983 she was brought by the Zurich Town Police before the District Attorney's Office where she was interrogated. Thereby she admitted having lived of the proceeds of prostitution. However, she stated that she had known Messrs.  K. and B. only by name and that she did not hand over to anybody part of her income as a prostitute.  As a result, the District Attorney D.J. remanded the applicant in custody on the same day. According to the warrant of arrest (Verhaftsverfügung) signed on 11 August 1983 by the District Attorney D.J., there was the urgent suspicion that members of the group ""Hell's Angels"" of Zurich and Hamburg had brought German prostitutes to Zurich.  There, in return for payment, some had married Swiss men.  These women had been urged, partly under threat, to commit professional prostitution whereby the ""Hell's Angels"" had protected the women who in turn had given them part of the proceeds.  The applicant was urgently suspected of having been one of these women.  The warrant of arrest stated that as a witness and under threat of punishment on account of false testimony she had denied any connection with the ""Hell's Angels"".  The warrant referred in particular to a danger of collusion and the danger that evidence would be destroyed.  It also stated that an appeal against the order of arrest could be filed within 48 hours with the Public Prosecutor's Office (Staatsanwaltschaft) of the Canton of Zurich. The applicant was released from detention on remand on 19 August 1983. On 12 October 1984 the Zurich District Attorney's Office indicted the applicant before the Judge in Criminal Cases at the Zurich District Court (Einzelrichter in Strafsachen am Bezirksgericht) on the grounds of false testimony in court proceedings and alternatively (eventualiter) of the hindrance of criminal proceedings and postulated a punishment of 5,000-.SF.  The bill of indictment was signed by the District Attorney D.J. who had also signed the warrant of arrest. The trial took place on 10 January 1985.  According to the minutes of the trial, the applicant's representative stated as follows: <Translation> ""In this case the first thing to note is a violation of the human right embodied in Article 5 para. 3 (Art. 5-3) of the European Convention on Human Rights which states that anyone who is arrested or detained in accordance with the provisions of Article 5 para. 1 (c) (Art. 5-1-c) of the Convention has to be brought promptly before a judge or other officer authorised by law to exercise judicial power.  This never happened in the present case.  Rather, the person who remanded the accused in custody, District Attorney J., is today at the same time the author of the bill of indictment.  I refer to a comparable application made to the European Commission of Human Rights in the cases of Schiesser and [X.] which were published in the journal 'Europäische Grundrechte-Zeitschrift'.  In that decision the condition for a violation of human rights was not met in view of the fact that the District Attorney who ordered the arrest was not the person who drew up the bill of indictment.  That case differs from the present one.  Be that as it may, I shall in any event refer this case to the higher authorities."" <German> ""Vorliegend wurde zunächst das in Art. 5 Ziff. 3 der Konvention zum Schutze der Menschenrechte und Grundfreiheiten (EMRK) statuierte Menschenrecht verletzt, wonach jede nach der Vorschrift von Art. 5 Ziff. 1 c) EMRK festgenommene oder in Haft gehaltene Person unverzüglich einem Richter oder einem anderen, gesetzlich zur Ausübung richterlicher Funktionen ermächtigten Beamten vorgeführt werden muss.  Eine solche Vorführung hat vorliegend nie stattgefunden; vielmehr ist derjenige, der die Angeklagte in Haft genommen hat, heute gleichzeitig Ankläger, nämlich der Bezirksanwalt J.  Ich verweise auf eine entsprechende Beschwerde, die an der Europäischen Menschenrechtskommission in Sachen Schiesser und [X.] anhängig gemacht worden und in der, Europäischen Grundrechtezeitschrift, veröffentlicht worden ist.  In jenem Entscheid wurde das Kriterium der Menschenrechtsverletzung verneint, weil der verhaftende Bezirksanwalt nicht mit dem anklagenden Bezirksanwalt identisch war, es sich mithin um einen andersgelagerten Fall als den vorliegenden Fall gehandelt hatte; ich werde auf jeden Fall diesen Fall weiterziehen."" On 10 January 1985 the Zurich District Court acquitted the applicant on the grounds that she had never been invited (vorgeladen) to an interrogation for which reason her testimony was invalid and could not be considered.  The judgment does not refer to the issues raised at the trial by the applicant's lawyer under Article 5 para. 3 (Art. 5-3) of the Convention. Upon appeal (Berufung) by the Public Prosecutor's Office the Zurich Court of Appeal (Obergericht) on 13 September 1985 convicted the applicant of attempted false testimony and sentenced her to a fine of 4,000 SF. The Court found that her testimony was not invalid and could be used.  It further referred to the monitoring of telephone conversations between the applicant and Mr.  K. which had been lawfully undertaken by the authorities in Germany and the minutes of which had been transmitted by way of legal cooperation to Switzerland.  The Court concluded on the basis of these minutes that the applicant had in fact known Messrs.  K. and B.  The judgment of the Court of Appeal also refers to the issue under Article 5 para. 3 (Art. 5-3) of the Convention: <Translation> ""Finally it must be noted that the applicant's lawyer unjustifiably put forward the objection that in the context of her arrest and in contravention of Article 5 para. 3 (Art. 5-3) of the Convention the accused had not been brought before a judge or other officer authorised by law to exercise judicial power.  For, according to the case-law of the Federal Court, the Zurich District Attorney exercises in the procedural stage of investigation also judicial power within the meaning of Article 5 para. 3 (Art. 5-3) of the Convention (ATF [Arrêts du Tribunal Fédéral] 102 Ia 179)."" <German> ""Schliesslich ist festzuhalten, dass der Einwand der Verteidigung, die Angeklagte sei im Zusammenhang mit ihrer Verhaftung in Verletzung von Art. 5 Ziff. 3 EMRK keinem Richter oder einem anderen gesetzlich zur Ausübung richterlicher Funktionen ermächtigten Beamten vorgeführt worden, zu Unrecht erfolgte.  Nach der Rechtsprechung des Bundesgerichtes übt nämlich der zürcherische Bezirksanwalt im Verfahrensstadium der Untersuchung auch richterliche Funktionen im Sinne von Art. 5 Ziff. 3 EMRK aus (ATF 102 Ia 179)."" The applicant filed a plea of nullity (Nichtigkeits- beschwerde) which was dismissed by the Zurich Court of Cassation (Kassationsgericht) on 1 July 1986.  The Court found that the issue under Article 5 para. 3 (Art. 5-3) of the Convention was irrelevant for the present case.  If the applicant therefore challenged the District Attorney she should have done so already during the investigation. The applicant then lodged a public law appeal with the Federal Court (Bundesgericht) in which she complained, inter alia, that, contrary to Article 5 para. 3 (Art. 5-3) of the Convention, the Zurich District Attorney had not only remanded the applicant in custody but also indicted her. The Federal Court dismissed the applicant's public law appeal on 24 November 1986.  The Court found first that according to S. 90 of the Federal Judiciary Act (Organisationsgesetz) the substantiation of a public law appeal has to be included in the appeal statement itself and that it could not therefore consider the notes of the applicant's representative in the proceedings concerning the Schiesser case before the European Court of Human Rights.  In respect of the applicant's complaint under Article 5 para. 3 (Art. 5-3) of the Convention the Court held: <Translation> ""As the applicant has long since been released from detention on remand, she no longer has an actual practical interest in a response to this complaint for which reason the Court can no longer deal with it.  The objection would in any event be unfounded since both the Federal Court (ATF 102 Ia 179ff) and the European Court of Human Rights (judgment of 4 December 1979 in the Schiesser case) have declared that the Zurich District Attorney qualifies in the procedural phase of the investigation as an 'officer authorised by law to exercise judicial power' within the meaning of Article 5 para. 3 (Art. 5-3) of the Convention."" <German> ""Nachdem die Beschwerdeführerin längst aus der Untersuchungshaft entlassen worden ist, hat sie jedoch kein aktuelles praktisches Interesse mehr an der Behandlung dieser Rüge, weshalb darauf nicht einzutreten ist.  Der Vorwurf wäre übrigens unbegründet, da sowohl das Bundesgericht (ATF 102 Ia 179ff.) als auch der Europäische Gerichtshof für Menschenrechte (Urteil vom 4.  Dezember 1979 in Sachen Schiesser) erklärt haben, der zürcherische Bezirksanwalt sei im Verfahrensstadium der Untersuchung ein 'gesetzlich zur Ausübung richterlicher Funktionen ermächtigter Beamter' im Sinne von Art. 5 Ziff. 3 EMRK."" The judgment was served on the applicant on 18 December 1986. II.     Relevant domestic law and practice According to S. 32 of the Judiciary Act (Gerichtsverfassungs- gesetz, GVG) of the Canton of Zurich of 1976 the District Court examines as a criminal court all matters not falling within the jurisdiction of another court.  S. 44 and 57 GVG state the various offences which the Court of Appeal and the Jury Court, respectively, are competent to decide; they do not include the charges brought against the applicant. S. 72 GVG provides that the District Attorney's Office acts as the indicting authority (Anklagebehörde) at the level of the District Court, and the Public Prosecutor's Office before the Court of Appeal and the Jury Court (Geschworenengericht).  S. 73 GVG states that the investigation of offences is conducted by the District Attorney's Office and the Public Prosecutor's Office.  In practice, most investigations are carried out by the District Attorney.  As a rule, District Attorneys are elected for office by the people for four years (S. 86 para. 2 GVG). S. 55 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (Strafprozessordnung, StPO) of the Canton of Zurich of 1919 authorises the District Attorney to issue a warrant of arrest.  Against the latter an appeal may be filed. S. 64 StPO obliges the District Attorney to hear an arrested suspect within twenty-four hours.  According to S. 65 StPO, the suspect must thereby be clearly informed of the reasons prompting the suspicion held against him. Detention on remand ordered by the District Attorney may not exceed 14 days, except if continuation is ordered by the President of the District Court or of the Prosecuting Chamber (Anklagekammer) of the Court of Appeal, depending on the jurisdiction of the respective Court (S. 51 StPO). Once the investigation has been closed and the prosecution has not been discontinued, the indicting authority, i.e. the District Attorney's Office or the Public Prosecutor's Office, commence the main proceedings (Hauptverfahren) by submitting the bill of indictment (S. 161 StPO).  The President of the District Court or of the Prosecuting Chamber of the Court of Appeal will then decide whether or not to admit the bill of indictment (S. 165 StPO).  S. 178 StPO states: <Translation> ""The indicting authority is a party to the main proceedings.  It has as such all the rights and duties of a party. In his statement the indicting officer should not one-sidedly confine himself to stressing items that tell against the accused, but should also take into account items in his favour."" <German> ""Die Anklagebehörde ist im Hauptverfahren Prozesspartei.  Sie hat alle einer solchen zustehenden Rechte und Pflichten. Der Ankläger soll bei seinen Vorträgen nicht einseitig nur dasjenige hervorheben, was den Angeschuldigten beschweren kann, sondern auch das berücksichtigen, was zu seinen Gunsten spricht."" The District Attorney remains under the control of the Public Prosecutor's Office (S. 86 GVG), and the latter is authorised to issue directives to him (S. 27 StPO).  In practice District Attorneys receive no special orders or instructions from the Public Prosecutor's Office concerning their powers of placing individuals in detention. Apart from the power to order arrest and detention and to interrogate the arrested suspect, the District Attorney has the power to issue a summons order (Strafbefehl) if the accused has confessed and admitted his guilt, and if a fine (Busse) or prison sentence of a maximum of one month is considered to be adequate (S. 317 StPO). After conviction, S. 419 StPO envisages an appeal to the Court of Appeal in which complaints can be raised against all defects (Mängel) both of the investigation and of the procedure (Verfahren) and the decision of the first instance court. COMPLAINTS The applicant now complains that, contrary to Article 5 para. 3 (Art. 5-3) of the Convention, the same District Attorney decided on the applicant's detention and later also indicted her.  Thus the District Attorney could not be regarded as having been independent within the meaning of that provision. In her reply to the Government's observations the applicant also stated on 13 April 1988, in connexion with her submissions as to whether she had complied with the conditions of Article 26 (Art 26) of the Convention, that the Federal Court should also have entered into her public law appeal in accordance with Article 13 (Art. 13) of the Convention. PROCEEDINGS BEFORE THE COMMISSION The application was introduced on 27 February 1987 and registered on 13 March 1987. On 7 October 1987 the Commission decided to bring the application to the notice of the respondent Government and to invite them pursuant to Rule 42 para. 2 (b) of the Rules of Procedure to submit observations on its admissibility and merits, in respect of the complaints under Article 5 para. 3 (Art. 5-3) of the Convention relating to the functions of the District Attorney concerned. The respondent Government's observations were submitted on 18 December 1987 and the reply thereto by the applicant on 13 April 1988. SUBMISSIONS OF THE PARTIES A.    The respondent Government&- I.      The facts The Government's submissions as to the facts have been included in THE FACTS above. II.     General considerations The Government note that the present application raises the same issues as those before the Convention organs in the cases of Schiesser (Eur.  Court H.R., judgment of 4 December 1979, Series A No. 34) and X. (No. 8485/79, Dec. 17.3.81, D.R. 22 p. 131 ff).  In both cases, the Convention organs concluded that the Zurich District Attorney was indeed a ""judge or other officer authorised by law to exercise judicial power"" within the meaning of Article 5 para. 3 (Art. 5-3) of the Convention.  This officer was therefore entitled to order detention on remand. In the applicant's submissions, however, the present application differs essentially from the above cases with the result that that case-law cannot be applied here.  In particular, the District Attorney who ordered her arrest was also the person who later drew up the bill of indictment.  Thus, in the applicant's submission this officer no longer fulfilled the condition of impartiality. III.    As to the exhaustion of domestic remedies (Article 26 (Art. 26) of the Convention) 1.      According to the Commission's case-law Article 26 (Art. 26) of the Convention requires the observance of the relevant procedural requirements under domestic law.  Thus, there is no exhaustion of domestic remedies within the meaning of this provision if a domestic appeal has been declared inadmissible on account of a failure to observe a procedural requirement (see No. 6878/75, Dec. 6.10.76, D.R. 6 p. 79 ff). The Government submit that, in the present case, the applicant has not observed the procedural conditions prescribed under Swiss law.  S. 90 of the Federal Judiciary Act requires that in the case of a public law appeal the appeal statement specifying the constitutional rights or legal principles allegedly violated must state the relevant grounds.  However, the applicant's lawyer merely referred to the submissions he had made before the European Court of Human Rights in the Schiesser case.  The Swiss Federal Court considered this to be incompatible with S. 90 of the Federal Judiciary Act and in its judgment of 24 November 1986 the Court therefore did not enter into the applicant's public law appeal.  The Government therefore conclude that the applicant has for this reason not exhausted domestic remedies. 2.      The Government submit that also in another respect the conditions of the exhaustion of domestic remedies within the meaning of Article 26 (Art. 26) of the Convention have not been fulfilled.  According to the case-law of the Convention organs the applicant must have expounded, at least in substance, the complaints she intends to raise before the Commission. As for a State seeking to shelter behind the duty to exhaust remedies, it is for the State to ""establish the existence of available remedies that have not been utilised by those concerned"" (see Eur.  Court H.R., Foti and others judgment of 10 December 1982, Series A No. 56, p. 17 para. 48).  Moreover, ""the only remedies which Article 26 (Art. 26) of the Convention requires to be exercised are those that relate to the breaches alleged and at the same time are available and sufficient"" (see Eur.  Court H.R., Van Oosterwijck judgment of 6 November 1980, Series A No. 40, pp. 13f para. 27).  The remedies must exist with a sufficient degree of certainty, both in practice and in theory, otherwise they lack the requisite availability and effectiveness (see, mutatis mutandis, Eur.  Court H.R., Van Droogenbroeck judgment of 24 June 1982, Series A No. 30, p. 30 para. 54).  It lies with the respondent Government to demonstrate that these various conditions have been fulfilled (see Eur.  Court H.R., Deweer judgment of 27 February 1980, Series A No. 35, pp. 15 and 18f, paras. 26 and 32, respectively). The Government submit that in the present case the applicant should therefore have lodged an appeal against her arrest by the Zurich District Attorney.  Here, the Government specify that the offence of false testimony in connection with procuring falls within the jurisdiction of the District Attorney and that the arrest of the applicant was carried out in this context.  The applicant should, therefore, have expected as soon as she was arrested that the officer who had ordered her arrest would also subsequently, in principle, decide on the drawing up of the bill of indictment.  The Government refer here to S. 44, 56 and 72 of the Judiciary Act of the Canton of Zurich. In this context, the cases of Schiesser and X. mentioned above are of particular relevance.  In the Schiesser case, that applicant lodged an appeal against the order of arrest, and in the last instance the Swiss Federal Court delivered its judgment in which it rejected the applicant's public law appeal.  In the case of X. an appeal was lodged against the decision to extend the detention. Again, the Federal Court delivered judgment in the last instance in which it rejected that applicant's public law appeal. The Government refer to these two cases for a further reason. The lawyer representing those two applicants is also now representing the present applicant.  He should therefore be particularly well versed in the problems of the case and the remedies available to him. Failure to make use of the remedies available is thus even less excusable. As regards the circumstances of the present case the Government note that the applicant was arrested on 11 August 1983.  The arrest order was served on her the same day by the District Attorney, Mr.  D.J., and bears the signature of the applicant.  This order expressly provides for the possibility of an appeal (see THE FACTS above).  However, the applicant did not avail herself of this possibility and the decision to arrest her has therefore never been contested. On 17 August 1983, while still in detention, the applicant appointed as her representative the lawyer now representing her before the Commission.  On his advice she could, on the basis of Article 5 para. 4 (Art. 5-4) of the Convention, have had the legality of her detention examined by filing a request for her release, which under Swiss criminal procedural law is the normal procedure.  While the Zurich Code of Criminal Procedure does not expressly provide for this procedure, it exists in practice.  In accordance with this practice, the person detained may at any time submit a request for release to competent examining authorities.  In the last instance the Federal Court, when deciding on a public law appeal, could have pronounced itself on the legality of this deprivation of freedom.  The Government refer here to various publications of Swiss authors.  It is undisputed that the applicant never requested her release. The Government thus note that the applicant contested neither the order of arrest nor the legality of the detention.  Clearly, therefore, the condition of the exhaustion of domestic remedies has not been complied with. The Government observe further that the District Attorney D.J. carried out the whole enquiry in the applicant's case.  On 12 October 1984, he drew up the bill of indictment against the applicant for false testimony and hindrance of criminal proceedings.  Throughout the procedure before the examining authorities the applicant's lawyer took no action.  He merely participated at the hearing of 27 September 1984. Throughout this period, no appeal was lodged and the procedure was never contested as such. The applicant's lawyer did not invoke a violation of Article 5 para. 3 (Art. 5-3) until the trial on 10 January 1985, i.e. 17 months after the applicant's arrest and 3 months after the bill of indictment (see THE FACTS above).  In its judgment, the District Court did not go into the merits of this allegation. The Zurich Court of Appeal, in considering an appeal lodged by the Public Prosecutor's Office, confined itself in its judgment of 13 September 1985 to referring in general terms to the case-law of the Swiss Federal Court, according to which during the investigation the Zurich District Attorney exercises judicial functions within the meaning of Article 5 para. 3 (Art. 5-3) of the Convention. After her conviction by the Court of Appeal on 13 September 1985, the applicant filed a plea of nullity with the Court of Cassation of the Canton of Zurich.  The latter did not in its judgment of 1 July 1986 consider the merits of the allegation that the District Attorney was not a judge.  It merely stated that any such challenge should have been made during the investigation.  Since no such challenge had been made, it could no longer revert to the matter. Nor did the decision of the Federal Court of 24 November 1986 on the applicant's public law appeal go into the merits of the issue raised under Article 5 para. 3 (Art. 5-3) of the Convention since the applicant no longer had any actual practical interest to have this issue determined. 3.      The Government thus conclude that before the Federal Court the applicant did not observe the procedural requirements laid down in S. 90 of the Federal Judiciary Act, as would be required by domestic law (see para. 1 above).  Moreover, the applicant did not make timely use of the appropriate legal procedures to contest either the decision to arrest her or the investigation.  Finally the applicant submitted her complaint based on Article 5 para. 3 (Art. 5-3) of the Convention at too late a stage, namely during the trial.  The Swiss courts therefore declared this complaint inadmissible (see para. 2 above). The Government therefore consider that the applicant has in respect of her present application not complied with the conditions of the exhaustion of domestic remedies within the meaning of Article 26 (Art. 26) of the Convention. IV.     As to the well-foundedness of the application The Government recall that the complaint under Article 5 para. 3 (Art. 5-3) of the Convention is not new insofar as it relates to the Zurich District Attorney's functions.  In the Schiesser case the Government had ample opportunity to express their views on these issues.  The Government's written observations have been published in Eur.  Court H.R., Series B No. 32.  In the light of the above the Government are convinced that the application is inadmissible for failure to comply with the requirements of the exhaustion of domestic remedies within the meaning of Article 26 (Art. 26) of the Convention.  The Government refrain therefore for the time being from expounding any substantive argument, while respectfully referring the Commission to the various conclusions published in Series B No. 32, pp. 39-59 and 78-90.  However, the Government reserve the right to revert to the merits of the present application, should the Commission declare it admissible. V.      Conclusion On the basis of Articles 26 and 27 para. 3 (Art. 26, Art. 27-3) of the Convention, the respondent Government invite the Commission to declare the application inadmissible. B.      The applicant I.      The facts The applicant's submissions as to the facts have been included in THE FACTS above. II.     As to the exhaustion of domestic remedies (Article 26 (Art. 26) of the Convention) According to S. 419 of the Zurich Code of Criminal Procedure, an appeal is possible against the investigation as well as the first instance procedure and judgment.  A fortiori this must apply to the first instance proceedings themselves.  The applicant was therefore free to let the decision to detain her go unchallenged for the time being.  This decision did not acquire legal force.  It was possible and permissible for her to bring the issue up again during the trial. The applicant doubtlessly and correctly followed the sequence of domestic remedies.  In the context of her public law appeal, the Federal Court intervened, or should have intervened, in respect of the complaint concerning the judge ordering detention. The Federal Court denied the applicant's practical interest and did not enter into her complaint.  However in the next sentence of its decision the Court, as the Supreme Court handing down judgments which are nationally binding, stated that the objection lodged would in any event be unfounded, since both the Federal Court itself and as the European Court considered that the Zurich District Attorney acting in the investigation qualified as an officer authorised by law to exercise judicial power within the meaning of Article 5 para. 3 (Art. 5-3) of the Convention.  Once such a statement has been made, it is not possible afterwards simply to hide behind formal aspects.  In actual fact, the Federal Court stated its position.  It is common knowledge that these ""in any event"" statements have both in practice and in theory the effect of preliminary rulings. The Federal Court's decision not to intervene starkly contradicts its own practice whereby the Court consistently renounces the requirement of a current practical interest.  In particular, the Court will examine the complaint, if the intervention complained of could be repeated at any time, and if in the individual case a timely constitutional review would hardly ever be possible (kaum je möglich wäre), so that the requirement of a practical interest would exclude the review of constitutionality.  The applicant refers here to ATF 107 Ia 139 and 108 Ia 42. However, in most cases persons detained on remand are released before the Federal Court takes its decision on the application for release.  If this criterion were applied, therefore, applications for release would largely be denied the possibility of constitutional review.  As a result, the Federal Court regularly enters into public law appeals concerning the imposition of detention on remand without applying the requirement of current practical interest.  It goes without saying that this must also apply to applications for release from detention on remand which have been complained of upon appeal, in so far as this is admissible under the relevant cantonal code of criminal procedure, as in the instant case under S. 419. In accordance with its constitutional importance and responsibility, the Federal Court as a rule also relinquishes the requirement of a personal interest where a complaint raises questions of fundamental importance, where priority must be given to the discharge of the Federal Court's function as supervisor of the rule of law, democracy and the Federal State.  The applicant submits that the question of the independence of the judge deciding on detention on remand within the meaning of the Convention lies at the centre of constitutional credibility. In fact, the Federal Court should have entered into the public law appeal in accordance with Article 13 (Art. 13) of the Convention.  Under that provision, the applicant has the right to an effective remedy before a national authority when rights or freedoms under the Convention have been violated, notwithstanding that the violation has been committed by persons acting in an official capacity.  If, when a Convention violation has been alleged, the Federal Court takes no action because the violation has ceased in the meanwhile, it renders the guaranteed legal protection under the Convention devoid of all effect. The Federal Court did not conclude that the previous remedies had been employed incorrectly.  The previous cases before the Convention organs concerning the District Attorney merely demonstrate that the issue can also be raised independently in appeal proceedings. The previous cases demonstrate that the complaint may no longer be raised and taken before a higher court in the context of complaints concerning the trial. III.    As to the well-foundedness of the complaint under Article 5 para. 3 (Art. 5-3) of the Convention The applicant submits that the safeguard of the independence of judges in a constitutional state is a self-evident truth.  In the present case, the applicant, with the assistance of the municipal police, was taken on 11 August 1983 to the office of the District Attorney in Zurich, on the strength of a warrant of arrest issued by that office, where she was interrogated as a witness.  She was then placed in detention on remand by the District Attorney D.J.  On 12 October 1984 the same District Attorney D.J. indicted the applicant before the Zurich District Court.  Thus the same person D.J. was both the judge deciding on detention on remand and the prosecutor.  However, a prosecutor can never be a judge or an officer authorised by law to exercise judicial power within the meaning of Article 5 para. 3 (Art. 5-3) of the Human Rights Convention.  The prosecutor is a party. IV.     Conclusion The applicant appears to request the Commission to declare the application admissible and to find a breach of Article 5 para. 3 (Art. 5-3) of the Convention. THE LAW 1.      The applicant complains that the same District Attorney, who remanded her in custody, later also indicted her.  Thus, the District Attorney could not be regarded as having been independent and was not ""a judge or other officer authorised by law to exercise judicial power"" within the meaning of Article 5 para. 3 (Art. 5-3) of the Convention. The applicant submits that she complied with the conditions of the exhaustion of domestic remedies within the meaning of Article 26 (Art. 26) of the Convention.  She refers in particular to S. 419 of the Zurich Code of Criminal Procedure which envisages an appeal after conviction by the District Court to complain both about defects of the investigation and the trial.  The applicant also draws attention to the decision of the Federal Court of 24 November 1986 in which the Court found that the applicant no longer had an interest in her public law appeal, but then continued that the complaint would in any event also be unfounded. Article 5 para. 3 (Art. 5-3) of the Convention states: ""Everyone arrested or detained in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 1 (c) of this Article shall be brought promptly before a judge or other officer authorised by law to exercise judicial power and shall be entitled to trial within a reasonable time or to release pending trial.  Release may be conditioned by guarantees to appear for trial."" 2.      The respondent Government submit in respect of Article 26 (Art. 26) of the Convention that the applicant has not complied with the conditions of the exhaustion of domestic remedies.  In the Government's opinion, after the applicant was remanded in custody, she failed to file an appeal against her arrest and detention.  She should have expected that the officer, who remanded her in custody, would also indict her, a fortiori as her lawyer had participated in other proceedings before the Convention organs concerning the same matter and was therefore aware of these issues.  The Government point out that subsequently the Court of Appeal, in its judgment of 13 September 1985, confined itself to some general remarks, and that the Court of Cassation, in its judgment of 1 July 1986, did not consider the merits of the allegations. The Government further draw attention to the decision of the Federal Court of 24 November 1986 in which the Court found that the applicant lacked interest in her public law appeal as she had meanwhile been released from detention on remand.  The Federal Court also found that the applicant had, in the substantiation of her public law appeal, not complied with the requirements under Swiss law. The Government thus conclude that the applicant did not make timely use of the appropriate remedies to contest her arrest or the investigation procedure, and that she did not observe the requirements under Swiss law for filing a public law appeal. Under Article 26 (Art. 26) of the Convention the Commission may only deal with a matter after all domestic remedies have been exhausted according to the generally recognised rules of international law. The Commission has first examined the Government's submissions according to which the applicant did not make timely use of the appropriate remedies to contest her arrest and detention on remand, and that the Federal Court found in its decision of 24 November 1986 that she lacked an interest in her public law appeal. The Commission considers, on the one hand, that in the light of the Zurich Judiciary Act and the Zurich Code of Criminal Procedure it was probable that the District Attorney's Office would eventually indict the applicant.  In the Commission's opinion, however, it has not been made clear by the respondent Government how the applicant, or her representative, could thereby be expected to foresee that even the same officer at the District Attorney's Office, who had previously remanded her in custody, would eventually also indict her. On the other hand, the Commission notes that S. 419 of the Zurich Code of Criminal Procedure expressly envisages the possibility of an appeal with the Court of Appeal after conviction by the District Court, whereby complaints can be directed both against the investigation and the procedure and the decision of the District Court. In the present case the applicant raised her complaints under Article 5 para. 3 (Art. 5-3) of the Convention at the trial on 10 January 1985 after it became clear that the same District Attorney who remanded the applicant in custody also indicted her.  Upon the applicant's acquittal by the District Court the Public Prosecutor's Office filed an appeal, whereupon the Court of Appeal on 13 September 1985 convicted the applicant.  The Commission notes that in its judgment the Court of Appeal in fact dismissed the applicant's complaint under Article 5 para. 3 (Art. 5-3) as being unfounded in the light of the Federal Court's case-law, rather than declaring it inadmissible as being out of time. It is true that the Federal Court, in its judgment of 24 November 1986, declined to enter into the complaints under Article 5 para. 3 (Art. 5-3) of the Convention in view of the fact that the applicant had meanwhile been released from detention and therefore lacked an actual practical interest in her public law appeal.  However, the Commission notes that the Federal Court then proceeded to state that in any event, in view of its own and the European Court's case-law on the matter, the complaint under Article 5 para. 3 (Art. 5-3) of the Convention would also be unfounded. The Commission is therefore satisfied that the Federal Court in fact dealt with this complaint in substance, and that the applicant has therefore in this respect complied with Article 26 (Art. 26) of the Convention. Insofar as the Government submit that the applicant did not observe the procedural requirements for filing a public law appeal the Commission recalls its constant case-law according to which there is no exhaustion of domestic remedies where a domestic appeal is not admitted because of a procedural mistake (see No. 6878/75, Dec. 6.10.76, D.R. 6 p. 79). In the present case the Commission notes that in its decision of 24 November 1986 the Federal Court found that according to S. 90 of the Federal Judiciary Act the substantiation of a public law appeal has to be included in the appeal statement and that it could not therefore consider the notes of the applicant's representative relating to proceedings before the European Court of Human Rights. However, the Commission also observes that the Federal Court did not regard the applicant's public law appeal statement itself as being insufficiently substantiated.  Indeed, the Federal Court then proceeded to discuss the applicant's complaint under Article 5 para. 3 (Art. 5-3) of the Convention.  Also for this reason, therefore, the applicant complied with Article 26 (Art. 26) of the Convention. The applicant's complaints cannot therefore be rejected under Article 26 (Art. 26) of the Convention for non-exhaustion of domestic remedies. 3.      The Government have further referred to their submissions in the proceedings in the Schiesser case before the European Court of Human Rights (see Series B No. 32, pp. 39 ff and 78 ff). The Commission considers that the applicant's complaint under Article 5 para. 3 (Art. 5-3) of the Convention, relating to the functions of the District Attorney concerned, raises difficult questions of fact and law which are of such complexity that their determination should depend on an examination of the merits.  The application is therefore not manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 27 para. 2 (Art. 27-2) of the Convention, and must be declared admissible, no other grounds for declaring it inadmissible having been established. 4.  In her reply to the Government's observations the applicant submitted on 13 April 1988 that the Federal Court should have entered into her public law appeal according to Article 13 (Art. 13) of the Convention.  An issue could arise whether these submissions have been introduced in time within the meaning of Article 26 (Art. 26) of the Convention in view of the fact that they were filed more than six months after the Federal Court gave its judgment on 24 November 1986.  However, the Commission considers that both the content of the submissions and their context make it clear that the applicant, rather than filing a new complaint, was intending to buttress her argument that she had in fact complied with the requirement under Article 26 (Art. 26) of the Convention as to the exhaustion of domestic remedies in respect of her complaint under Article 5 para. 3 (Art. 5-3) of the Convention. For these reasons, the Commission DECLARES THE APPLICATION ADMISSIBLE without prejudging the merits of the case. Secretary to the Commission               President of the Commission (H. C.

C.A. NØRGAARD, President J.A. FROWEIN G. SPERDUTI E. BUSUTTIL G. JÖRUNDSSON A.S. GÖZÜBÜYÜK A. WEITZEL J.-C. SOYER H.G. SCHERMERS H. DANELIUS H. VANDENBERGHE Mrs.  G.H. THUNE Sir  Basil HALL MM.  F. MARTINEZ C.L. ROZAKIS Mrs.  J. LIDDY Mr.  J. RAYMOND, Deputy Secretary to the Commission Having regard to Article 25 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms; Having regard to the application introduced on 9 July 1987 by S. against Switzerland and registered on 23 October 1987 under file No. 13325/87; Having regard to the report provided for in Rule 40 of the Rules of Procedure of the Commission; Having deliberated; Decides as follows: THE FACTS The applicant, an Egyptian citizen born in 1951, is a student residing in Stuttgart in the Federal Republic of Germany.  Before the Commission he is represented by Ursula and Rainer Röder, lawyers practising in Stuttgart. In 1976 the applicant married in Cairo an Egyptian national, who was the daughter of an Egyptian father and a Swiss mother.  The son Sh. of the applicant and his wife was born in 1982.  In December 1984 the applicant declared his marriage divorced whereupon the Misr El Gedia Court in Egypt enforced the divorce.  His former wife has remarried and lives in Stuttgart together with Sh. On 20 December 1985 the Stuttgart District Court (Amtsgericht) conferred the parental custody over the applicant's son to his former wife.  The applicant appealed against this decision, alleging that according to the Hanefitic doctrine of Egyptian-Islamic law the father had the parental custody, whereas the mother had the factual custody. This appeal was granted by the Stuttgart Court of Appeal (Oberlandes- gericht) on 10 March 1986.  The decision has acquired legal force. On 18 March 1986 the applicant's former wife obtained a declaration under Article 57 para. 8 (a) of the Swiss Nationality Code (Bürgerrechtsgesetz) according to which she was recognised (Anerkennung) as a Swiss citizen.  The son was included in the act of recognition.  The recognition was confirmed upon appeal by the Council of State (Regierungsrat) of Basel-Landschaft on 30 September 1986.  The Council of State took note in particular of the decision of the Stuttgart Court of Appeal but found that disregard of the interests of the child would run counter to the Swiss ordre public. The applicant's administrative court appeal (Verwaltungs- gerichtsbeschwerde) against this decision was dismissed by the Federal Court (Bundesgericht) on 3 April 1987.  The Court found in particular: ""The approval of the father can in any event be disregarded if, as here, the marriage of the parents has been dissolved before the application for recognition as a Swiss national has been submitted and, in addition, if the child will in all probability continue to live together with its mother and if the father cannot mention any convincing facts which, from the point of view of the interests of the child, would run counter to the inclusion into Swiss citizenship of the child.  In such circumstances it is actually irrelevant which parent has custody over the child. The applicant has not demonstrated, and it is not made clear, how the well-being of Sh. would require not to grant Swiss citizenship.  As the Council of State found, the dual nationality will not result in any disadvantages.  This conclusion is not affected by the consideration that the (today five-year old) boy may in future possibly be confronted with the decision where he wants to comply with his duty to military service.  The Swiss citizenship gives him the advantage that he can at any time enter Switzerland, i.e. the home country of his mother with whom he is living together (in a neighbouring country).  It is irrelevant if the applicant submits that he has close ties with his child since Sh. will not lose the Egyptian nationality - a fact which the applicant accepts."" COMPLAINTS The applicant complains under Article 6 para. 1 of the Convention that in the proceedings at issue he was not personally heard by the Swiss authorities. Under Articles 8 and 9 of the Convention the applicant complains that the recognition of his son as a Swiss citizen, upon application of his former wife, runs counter to the decision of the Stuttgart Court of Appeal of 10 March 1986 in that it violates his fatherly honour and his rights under Islamic law which grant the father parental custody over the child.  Moreover, his son had no ties with Switzerland.  Finally, difficulties will arise in respect of the son's military service. THE LAW 1.      The applicant complains under Article 6 para. 1 (Art. 6-1) of the Convention that in the proceedings at issue he was never personally heard by the Swiss authorities.  Article 6 para. 1 (Art. 6-1), first sentence, provides: ""In the determination of his civil rights and obligations or of any criminal charge against him, everyone is entitled to a fair and public hearing within a reasonable time by an independent and impartial tribunal established by law."" The Commission has previously held that Article 6 para. 1 (Art 6-1) does not apply to proceedings regulating a person's citizenship (cf. No. 5258/71, Dec. 8.2.1973, Collection 43 p. 71). The proceedings in which the present applicant was involved concerned his contestation of the recognition of his son as a Swiss citizen.  It follows from the above case-law that such proceedings do not involve either ""the determination of his civil rights and obligations or of any criminal charge against him"" within the meaning of Article 6 para. 1 (Art. 6-1) of the Convention.  Consequently, this provision does not apply to these proceedings. It follows that this part of the application is incompatible ratione materiae with the provisions of the Convention within the meaning of Article 27 para. 2 (Art. 27-2) of the Convention. 2.      The applicant further complains under Articles 8 and 9 (Art. 8, 9) of the Convention that the recognition of the son's Swiss nationality, upon application of his former wife, violates his fatherly honour and his right under Islamic law to exercise parental custody.  Difficulties will arise in respect of the son's military service. The Commission has first examined these complaints under Article 8 (Art. 8) of the Convention which states: ""1.      Everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life, his home and his correspondence. 2.      There shall be no interference by a public authority with the exercise of this right except such as is in accordance with the law and is necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security, public safety or the economic well-being of the country, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others."" Insofar as the applicant complains that he has been hurt in his fatherly honour or that difficulties will arise in respect of his son's military service, the Commission considers that the measure at issue does not constitute an interference with the applicant's right to respect for private and family life within the meaning of Article 8 para. 1 (Art. 8-1) of the Convention. The applicant also complains that under Islamic law it is up to him as the holder of parental custody to decide such matters. However, the Commission finds that there is nothing in the authorities' conduct which would indicate a lack of respect for the applicant's private and family life.  As a result, also in this respect there is no interference with the applicant's rights under Article 8 para. 1 (Art. 8-1) of the Convention. Insofar as the applicant invokes Article 9 (Art. 9) of the Convention, which protects the right to freedom of religion, the Commission finds that the facts of the case do not disclose any appearance of a violation of this provision. It follows that this part of the application is manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 27 para. 2 (Art. 27-2) of the Convention. For these reasons, the Commission DECLARES THE APPLICATION INADMISSIBLE. Deputy Secretary to the Commission     President of the Commission (J. RAYMOND)                      (C.A.

SWEDEN (Application no. 10930/84) JUDGMENT STRASBOURG 27 October 1987 In the Bodén case [*] , The European Court of Human Rights, sitting, in accordance with Article 43 (art. 43) of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (""the Convention"") and the relevant provisions of the Rules of Court, as a Chamber composed of the following judges: Mr. R. Ryssdal , President , Mr. G. Lagergren , Mr. F. Gölcüklü , Mr. L-E. Pettiti , Mr. R. Macdonald , Mr. R. Bernhardt , Mr. J. De Meyer , and also of Mr. M.-A. Eissen , Registrar , and Mr. H. Petzold , Deputy Registrar , Having deliberated in private on 25 March and 24 September 1987, Delivers the following judgment, which was adopted on the last-mentioned date: PROCEDURE 1.   The case was referred to the Court by the European Commission of Human Rights (""the Commission"") on 18 July 1986, within the three-month period laid down by Article 32 § 1 and Article 47 (art. 32-1, art. 47) of the Convention. The case originated in an application (no. 10930/84) against the Kingdom of Sweden lodged with the Commission on 10 January 1984 under Article 25 (art. 25) by a Swedish citizen, Mr. Gunnar Bodén. The Commission’s request referred to Articles 44 and 48 (art. 44, art. 48) and to the declaration whereby Sweden recognised the compulsory jurisdiction of the Court (Article 46) (art. 46). The purpose of the request was to obtain a decision as to whether the facts of the case disclosed a breach by the respondent State of its obligations under Article 6 § 1 (art. 6-1) of the Convention. 2.   In response to the inquiry made in accordance with Rule 33 § 3 (d) of the Rules of Court, the applicant stated that he did not wish to take part in the proceedings pending before the Court. 3.   The Chamber of seven judges to be constituted included, as ex officio members, Mr. G. Lagergren, the elected judge of Swedish nationality (Article 43 of the Convention) (art. 43), and Mr. R. Ryssdal, the President of the Court (Rule 21 § 3 (b)). On 26 September 1986, the President drew by lot, in the presence of the Registrar, the names of the five other members, namely Mr. F. Gölcüklü, Mr. L.-E. Pettiti, Mr. R. Bernhardt, Mr. A.M. Donner and Mr. J. De Meyer (Article 43 in fine of the Convention and Rule 21 § 4) (art. 43). Mr. R. Macdonald, substitute judge, subsequently replaced Mr. Donner, who was prevented from taking part in the consideration of the case (Rules 22 § 1 and 24 § 1). 4.   The Swedish Government (""the Government"") informed the Registrar on 29 October 1986 that negotiations were being conducted with the applicant with a view to arriving at a friendly settlement and then, on 4 February 1987, that the negotiations had proved unsuccessful. 5.   Mr. Ryssdal, who had assumed the office of President of the Chamber (Rule 21 § 5), ascertained, through the Registrar, the views of the Agent of the Government and the Delegate of the Commission regarding the need for a written procedure. Having regard to their concurring statements, he decided on 26 February 1987 that it was not necessary for memorials to be filed (Rule 37 § 1) and directed that the oral proceedings should open on 23 March 1987 (Rule 38). Prior to that, on 12 and 18 February, the applicant had lodged claims for just satisfaction under Article 50 (art. 50) (Rule 49 taken together with Rule 1 (k)). He provided further particulars of these claims on 24 April at the request of the President. 6.   The hearing was held in public at the Human Rights Building, Strasbourg, on the appointed day. Immediately before it opened, the Court had held a preparatory meeting. There appeared before the Court: - for the Government Mr. H. Corell , Ambassador, Under-Secretary for Legal and Consular Affairs, Ministry for Foreign Affairs, Agent , Mr. P. Löfmarck , Under-Secretary for Legal Affairs, Ministry of Transport and Communications, Mr. H. Berglin , Legal Adviser, Ministry for Foreign Affairs, Advisers ; - for the Commission Mr. Gaukur Jörundsson , Delegate . The Court heard addresses by Mr. Corell for the Government and by Mr. Gaukur Jörundsson for the Commission, as well as their replies to the questions put by the Court and several judges. AS TO THE FACTS I.   PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE 7.   The applicant, Mr. Gunnar Bodén, was born in 1939. He is a Swedish citizen resident in Falun and a car driver by profession. He owned, together with his brother Mr. B. Bodén, the properties Källviken 1:18, 1:25 and 1:26. 8.   On 30 June 1977, the Falun Municipal Council (kommunfullmäktige) adopted an area plan (områdesplan) with a view to the development of a housing estate in an area including the applicant’s properties. On 9 February 1978, the Municipal Council decided to apply to the Government for an expropriation permit for this area. 9.   The applicant objected to the expropriation in respect of two of the three properties concerned, because, as he submitted to the Government, he doubted that they were needed for the development contemplated and, further, he wanted to live with his mother in his parents’ home situated on one of the properties. He claimed that, when working out and adopting the area plan, the Municipal Council had not taken his interests sufficiently into account, something that would have been possible within the framework of a somewhat modified plan. However, the Government, taking the view that the Municipal Council had shown the need to include the applicant’s properties, concluded that the conditions laid down in the Expropriation Act 1972 (expropriationslagen 1972:719 - ""the 1972 Act"") were satisfied. On 1 March 1979, they issued an expropriation permit. 10.   The decision indicated that the issue of the permit had to be followed by the institution of proceedings by the Municipality before a real estate court not later than 3 March 1980. An action, the object of which was to settle the terms of the expropriation (see paragraph 15 below), was commenced on 28 February 1980 before the Real Estate Court at the Falun District Court (tingsrätten). 11.   The applicant, his brother and the Municipality were involved in negotiations for a settlement until 2 July 1984. On that date, before the main hearings started, they finally concluded an agreement: the applicant and his brother were to sell the properties to the Municipality, which was to lease back to the applicant for a period of five years, with a possibility of prolongation, a house situated thereon. On 17 August, the Real Estate Court struck the case off its list since, as a result of the settlement, the Municipality had withdrawn its claim for expropriation. 12.   On 17 December 1986, after the present case had been brought before the European Court of Human Rights, the Municipality of Falun concluded an agreement with the applicant for the repurchase by him of the properties for 235,000 Swedish crowns, the same amount as it had paid for them in 1984. II.   RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW A. Town-planning law 13.   The Building Act 1947 (byggnadslagen 1947:385 - ""the 1947 Act"") is the main legal instrument governing planning in respect of the use of land for construction and urban development. It provides for the drawing up of a master plan (generalplan), which establishes within a municipality the framework for other and more detailed plans, namely city plans (stadsplaner) and building plans (byggnadsplaner). As in the present case, a municipal council may draw up an area plan, instead of a master plan. The manner in which area plans are elaborated and their content are not expressly governed by the 1947 Act but general principles of administrative law are, of course, applicable. B. Legislation on the issue of expropriation permits 14.   The issue of expropriation permits is governed by the 1972 Act. Under Chapter 3, section 1, such a permit is normally granted by the Government. For cases like the present, the grounds justifying the issue of a permit are stated in Chapter 2, section 1, of the 1972 Act (as amended by the Act of 1976:46), which reads as follows (translation from Swedish): ""Expropriation is allowed in order to enable a municipality to acquire rights over land which is needed, as a result of future societal requirements, for urban development (tätbebyggelse) or constructions in connection with such development. ... Within areas of urban development expropriation is allowed only if there is reason to assume that, within a foreseeable time, the area will be subject to building or other construction activities which are deemed important in the general interest, or if there is an urgent necessity for the municipality to acquire rights over the land for the furthering of planned building or for any other similar reason. ..."" However, a permit must not be granted if the purpose of the expropriation can be attained by other appropriate means, or if the disadvantages of the expropriation would outweigh, from general and individual points of view, its advantages (Chapter 2, section 12, of the 1972 Act). 15.   Under Chapter 3, section 4, of the 1972 Act, the sole effect in law of the issue of an expropriation permit is to confer on its holder an entitlement to acquire the designated property. Consequently, the issue of a permit leaves legally intact the owner’s right to use, sell, let or mortgage his property (see also paragraph 17 below), and does not automatically lead to expropriation. Before the expropriation can be finalised, its terms - such as the compensation to be paid to the owner and the boundaries of the expropriated area - have to be settled in proceedings before a real estate court. Moreover, the expropriation is not completed until the compensation - in principle equivalent to the market value - has been paid. 16.   The proceedings before the real estate court have to be instituted by the holder of the permit within the time-limit which it specifies, failing which the permit will lapse (Chapter 3, section 6, of the 1972 Act). The 1972 Act is silent as to the length of this time-limit and as to the criteria upon which it is to be fixed. However, Chapter 3, section 6, provides that it may be extended in special circumstances, or reduced if the owner so requests and establishes that the inconvenience for him in the expropriation remaining pending has increased significantly. No decision to reduce the time-limit can be taken until one year has elapsed since the issue of the expropriation permit. 17.   Some reasons for restricting the time-limit and, hence, the duration of the validity of expropriation permits were stated in the Bill 1972:109, page 227, which led to the 1972 Act (translation from Swedish): ""Naturally, the mere issue of an expropriation permit often places [the owner] in a state of uncertainty. In practice, his opportunities for disposing of his property by selling it, assigning the use thereof or having premises erected thereon are considerably restricted. He may also have difficulty in deciding whether to incur expenditure on upkeep or modernisation. The disadvantages resulting from an expropriation permit are evidently increased if the judicial proceedings are not set in motion for a long time."" C. Remedies available 18.   Generally speaking, the Swedish administration is not subject to supervision by the ordinary courts. Those courts entertain proceedings against the State only in contractual matters, on questions of extra-contractual liability and, under some statutes, in respect of administrative decisions. Judicial review of the administration’s acts is therefore primarily a matter for administrative courts. These courts comprise three levels: the county administrative courts (länsrätterna); the administrative courts of appeal (kammarrätterna); and the Supreme Administrative Court (regeringsrätten). They are composed of independent judges and enjoy, as a rule, wide powers which enable them not only to set aside administrative acts but also to vary or substitute them. There is, however, an important exception to this principle, in that no appeal may be made against decisions of the Government (see paragraph 20 below). 1. Appeals against municipal decisions to adopt an area plan or apply for an expropriation permit 19.   Chapter 7, section, 1 of the Municipal Act of 1977 (kommunallagen 1977:179) provides for and regulates, in a general way, the right to appeal (kommunalbesvär) against decisions by municipalities. This Act enables residents of the municipality to challenge, for instance, a municipal council’s decision to adopt an area plan or apply for an expropriation permit. At the relevant time, this remedy was exercisable before the County Administrative Board (länsstyrelsen), but only on the following grounds: failure to observe the statutory procedures, infringement of the law, ultra vires conduct, violation of the complainant’s own rights, or other unfairness. The appeal had to be filed within three weeks from the date on which approval of the minutes of the decision had been announced on the municipal notice-board. The County Administrative Board’s decision could, within three weeks from its notification to the complainant, be the subject of an appeal to the Supreme Administrative Court. These provisions were slightly amended in 1980, with effect from 1 January 1981, in that the first appeal now has to be made to the Administrative Court of Appeal and not to the County Administrative Board. 2. Appeals against a decision to issue an expropriation permit 20.   Swedish law contains no provision for appeals to the ordinary or the administrative courts against the Government’s decisions to issue expropriation permits. Accordingly, such decisions are in principle not subject to court review. However, there is a limited possibility to file a petition before the Supreme Administrative Court for re-opening of the proceedings (resningsansökan). Further particulars of this remedy appear in the Sporrong and Lönnroth judgment of 23 September 1982 (Series A no. 52, pp. 19-20, § 50). 3. Possibilities of compensation for prejudice 21.   The 1972 Act does not in principle provide for compensation for prejudice resulting from the length of the validity of, or failure to utilise, an expropriation permit. It does, however, contain one exception (Chapter 5, section 16): compensation is payable for prejudice occasioned by the issue of an expropriation permit if the authority or person to whom it was granted has instituted, but subsequently abandoned, proceedings before a real estate court (see paragraphs 15-16 above). 22.   According to Chapter 3, section 2, of the Civil Liability Act 1972 (skadeståndslagen 1972:207), acts of public authorities may give rise to an entitlement to compensation in the event of fault or negligence. However, under section 7, an action for damages will not lie in respect of decisions taken by Parliament, the Government, the Supreme Court, the Supreme Administrative Court or the National Social Security Court. PROCEEDINGS BEFORE THE COMMISSION 23.   In his application of 10 January 1984 to the Commission (no. 10930/84), Mr. Gunnar Bodén complained that the expropriation permit had been issued in breach of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (P1-1) and that he had no possibility of having the dispute relating to the issue of the permit reviewed by a tribunal satisfying the requirements of Article 6 § 1 (art. 6-1) of the Convention. 24.   On 5 December 1985, the Commission declared admissible the applicant’s complaint under Article 6 § 1 (art. 6-1). The remainder of the application was declared inadmissible. In its report of 15 May 1986 (Article 31) (art. 31), the Commission expressed the unanimous opinion that there had been a breach of Article 6 § 1 (art. 6-1). The full text of the Commission’s opinion is reproduced as an annex to the present judgment. FINAL SUBMISSIONS MADE TO THE COURT BY THE GOVERNMENT 25.  At the hearing on 23 March 1987, the Government requested the Court ""to find that the complaint falls outside the scope of Article 6 § 1 (art. 6-1)"". AS TO THE LAW I.   ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 6 § 1 (art. 6-1) 26.   The applicant complained that he did not have the opportunity under Swedish law to challenge before a court an expropriation permit affecting two properties of which he was part-owner (see paragraphs 7-9 above). He alleged a violation of Article 6 § 1 (art. 6-1) of the Convention, which, so far as is relevant, reads: ""In the determination of his civil rights and obligations ..., everyone is entitled to a ... hearing ... by [a] ... tribunal ..."" 27.   In view of the submissions made, the first issue to be resolved is the applicability of this provision and, more particularly, whether the instant case involved the ""determination"" of a ""civil right"". A.   Applicability of Article 6 § 1 (art. 6-1) 28.   According to the Court’s established case-law, Article 6 § 1 (art. 6-1) extends only to ""contestations"" (disputes) over ""civil rights and obligations"" which can be said, at least on arguable grounds, to be recognised under domestic law; it does not in itself guarantee any particular content for ""civil rights and obligations"" in the substantive law of the Contracting States (see, as the most recent authority, the W v. the United Kingdom judgment of 8 July 1987, Series A no. 121, pp. 32-33, § 73). 29.   The applicant’s right of ownership of the properties in issue is without doubt - and that was not disputed - a civil right (see, mutatis mutandis, the Sporrong and Lönnroth judgment of 23 September 1982, Series A no. 52, p. 29, § 79, and the Poiss judgment of 23 April 1987, Series A no. 117, p. 102, § 48). 30.   As to whether there was a ""contestation"" within the meaning of Article 6 § 1 (art. 6-1), regard should be had to the principles enunciated in the Court’s case-law, summarised in the Benthem judgment of 23 October 1985 (Series A no. 97, pp. 14-15, § 32): (a) Conformity with the spirit of the Convention requires that the word ""contestation"" (dispute) should not be construed too technically and should be given a substantive rather than a formal meaning. (b) The ""contestation"" (dispute) may relate not only to the actual existence of a right but also to its scope or the manner in which it may be exercised. It may concern both questions of fact and questions of law. (c) It must be genuine and of a serious nature. (d) The expression ""contestations sur (des) droits et obligations de caractère civil"" (disputes over civil rights and obligations) covers all proceedings the result of which is decisive for such rights and obligations. However, a tenuous connection or remote consequences do not suffice for Article 6 § 1 (art. 6-1): civil rights and obligations must be the object - or one of the objects - of the ""contestation"" (dispute); the result of the proceedings must be directly decisive for such a right. 31.  The Government maintained that the issue of the expropriation permit was purely a policy decision and that there was consequently no genuine ""contestation"" (dispute) concerning questions of law or of fact susceptible of judicial assessment; what was involved was rather an assessment ""so far removed from the exercise of the normal judicial function that the safeguards in Article 6 (art. 6) cannot be taken as covering resultant disagreements"". The Government in this respect referred to the van Marle and Others judgment of 26 June 1986 (Series A no. 101, p. 12, § 36). 32.   The Court does not share this view. According to his pleadings before the Commission, Mr. Gunnar Bodén’s allegations were, inter alia, that the application of the 1972 Act was arbitrary in his case and that the responsible authorities had not properly appreciated the public interest in expropriating his properties. More importantly, the Government informed the Court that before the permit was issued, the applicant had submitted arguments contesting that his properties were needed for the development contemplated and contending that, when working out and adopting the area plan, the Municipal Council had not taken his interests sufficiently into account (see paragraph 9 above). This being so, it appears that there existed a serious disagreement between Mr. Gunnar Bodén and the Swedish authorities which raised questions going to the lawfulness, under the applicable Swedish legislation, of the issue of the permit (see paragraph 14 above). Furthermore, the expropriation permit was decisive for the applicant’s property rights. It affected the very substance of ownership in that it authorised the Municipality of Falun to expropriate at any moment within the time-limit set in the permit. Mr. Gunnar Bodén’s right of property thereby became precarious and defeasible (see the above-mentioned Sporrong and Lönnroth judgment, Series A no. 52, p. 23, § 60). The objections lodged by the applicant with the Government against the Municipal Council’s request for an expropriation permit thus gave rise to a ""contestation"" (dispute) over one of his ""civil rights"", as those expressions are understood for the purposes of Article 6 § 1 (art. 6-1). This provision is therefore applicable to the present case. B. Compliance with Article 6 § 1 (art. 6-1) 33.   The Government admitted, should the Court find Article 6 § 1 (art. 6-1) to be applicable, that the applicant was not afforded the safeguards it sets out. The Court nevertheless has to ascertain whether the applicant enjoyed the ""right to a court"", guaranteed to him under Article 6 § 1 (art. 6-1) (see the Golder judgment of 21 February 1975, Series A no. 18, p. 18, § 36). 34.   The Government pointed out that both the Falun Municipal Council’s decision to adopt an area plan and its decision to request an expropriation permit could be challenged before the County Administrative Board and, subsequently, the Supreme Administrative Court (see paragraph 19 above). However, these two decisions were only preparatory steps which, in themselves, did not at that stage interfere with the applicant’s civil rights (see the above-mentioned Sporrong and Lönnroth judgment, Series A no. 52, pp. 30-31, § 85). This being so, the Court finds no reason to undertake a further examination of these remedies. 35.   The Government’s decision as to the issue of the permit was not open to appeal before either the ordinary or the administrative courts, or before any other body which could be considered to be a ""tribunal"" for the purposes of Article 6 § 1 (art. 6-1) (see paragraphs 18 and 20 above). Admittedly, the applicant could have challenged the lawfulness of such a decision by requesting the Supreme Administrative Court to re-open the proceedings. However, this extraordinary remedy does not, for the reasons set out in the above-mentioned Sporrong and Lönnroth judgment (p.31, § 86), meet the requirements of Article 6 § 1 (art. 6-1). 36.   Nor would the requirements of Article 6 § 1 (art. 6-1) have been satisfied by any possibility which the applicant might have had of seeking compensation for prejudice (see paragraphs 21-22 above). Such an action would have concerned only certain effects of the expropriation permit and would not have determined the lawfulness of its issue. C. Conclusion 37.   There was accordingly a violation of Article 6 § 1 (art. 6-1). II.   APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 50 (art. 50) 38.   Article 50 (art. 50) of the Convention provides: ""If the Court finds that a decision or a measure taken by a legal authority or any other authority of a High Contracting Party is completely or partially in conflict with the obligations arising from the ... Convention, and if the internal law of the said Party allows only partial reparation to be made for the consequences of this decision or measure, the decision of the Court shall, if necessary, afford just satisfaction to the injured party."" In letters received on 12 and 18 February 1987, the applicant sought by way of just satisfaction financial compensation for prejudice allegedly suffered and reimbursement of costs and expenses incurred. At the hearing on 23 March 1987, the Government stated that the applicant had not provided the Court with any precise information as to damage. As to his costs and expenses, they suggested that the Court should ask him to furnish further particulars, which he did on 24 April 1987. The Government and the Commission have not submitted any further comments. The Court considers that in the circumstances the question of just satisfaction is ready for decision (Rule 53 § 1 of the Rules of Court). A. Damage 39.   The applicant claimed 100,000 Swedish crowns (SEK) as compensation for pecuniary damage attributable to the increase in building costs over ten years. The Government disputed that any issue of compensation for pecuniary damage arose in the present case under Article 50 (art. 50). 40.   The breach found by the Court consists of the absence of a court remedy for the applicant to challenge the lawfulness of the issue of the expropriation permit. However, the applicant has not adduced sufficient evidence to establish that, had such a remedy been available to him, the domestic court would have arrived at a decision in his favour. Neither is it for the Court to inquire into the merits, under Swedish law, of the issue of the permit. It must also be observed that the parties concerned finally reached agreement as to the transfer of the properties in 1984 and as to their re-purchase in 1986. Consequently, the Court sees no cause to award the applicant any compensation in respect of pecuniary damage. 41.   The applicant also sought 85,000 SEK for non-pecuniary damage. As regards this claim, the Court shares the view of the Commission and the Government that, in the particular circumstances, the finding of a violation constitutes in itself adequate just satisfaction for the purposes of Article 50 (art. 50). B. Costs and expenses 42.   The applicant claimed: (a)   5,400 SEK in respect of legal fees referable to the Strasbourg proceedings; (b)   7,000 SEK for miscellaneous expenses (translation, typing, telephone, postage, etc.); (c)   7,710 SEK for the costs of registering ownership of the re-purchased properties; (d)   2,000 SEK for loss of earnings occasioned by his having been obliged to visit the offices of various Swedish authorities; (e)   7,000 SEK for his own work in preparing the case. The Government expressed their readiness to reimburse, in the event of the Court finding a violation of the Convention, all costs and expenses reasonably incurred by the applicant in connection with his case. 43.   (a) It was not disputed, and the Court considers, that the legal fees claimed were actually and necessarily incurred and reasonable as to quantum (see, inter alia, the Zimmermann and Steiner judgment of 13 July 1983, Series A no. 66, p. 14, § 36). (b) Although the applicant did not supply any vouchers, the Court is also satisfied that he incurred certain miscellaneous expenses with a view to obtaining redress of the violation by the Convention institutions. It finds it equitable to award 3,500 SEK under this head. (c) On the other hand, the costs of registering ownership of the re-purchased properties are not attributable to the absence of a court remedy. There is consequently no causal link between the violation found by the Court and these costs. (d) It has not been established that there is a sufficient connection between the visits alleged to have occasioned a loss of earnings and the matter held by the Court in the present judgment to be in breach of Article 6 § 1 (art. 6-1). (e) Since the applicant was assisted by a lawyer before the Commission and did not take part in the proceedings before the Court (see paragraph 2 above), the Court does not consider that the item of 7,000 SEK claimed for his own work can be regarded as ""necessary"" for the purposes of Article 50 (art. 50). Mr. Gunnar Bodén is consequently entitled to be reimbursed, for costs and expenses, the sum of 8,900 SEK, from which must be deducted the amount of 3,410 French francs already paid in respect of legal costs by the Council of Europe. FOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT UNANIMOUSLY 1. Holds that Article 6 § 1 (art. 6-1) applied in the instant case; 2. Holds that Article 6 § 1 (art. 6-1) has been violated; 3. Holds that the respondent State is to pay to the applicant in respect of costs and expenses the sum of 8,900 (eight thousand nine hundred) Swedish crowns, less 3,410 (three thousand four hundred and ten) French francs to be converted into Swedish crowns at the rate applicable on the date of delivery of the present judgment; 4. Rejects the remainder of the claim for just satisfaction. Done in English and in French, and delivered at a public hearing in the Human Rights Building, Strasbourg, on 27 October 1987. Rolv RYSSDAL President Marc-André EISSEN Registrar In accordance with Article 51 § 2 (art. 51-2) of the Convention and Rule 52 § 2 of the Rules of Court, the separate opinion of Mr. De Meyer, joined by Mr. Pettiti, is annexed to the present judgment. R.R. M.-A.E. SEPARATE OPINION OF JUDGE DE MEYER JOINED BY JUDGE PETTITI My remarks concerning paragraphs 30 and 31 of the judgment of today’s date in the Pudas case [1] also apply to paragraphs 28 and 30 of the judgment in the present case. The reasons set forth in paragraphs 29 and 32 of the present judgment suffice to establish that ""the instant case involved the ‘determination’ of a ‘civil right’"" [2] . Those in paragraph 32 furthermore suffice to establish, as far as necessary, that there was a dispute (""contestation"") concerning that right.

The applicant returned to Scotland in July 1975 to resume her academic studies.  In autumn of that year, the Head of the Chinese Department at Edinburgh University asked the applicant to act as Secretary to the Scotland-China Association which was a group under the patronage of the Department and to which most of the Department's students belonged. In autumn 1976, the applicant was employed as an on-screen reporter for Scottish Television (an independent company).  She applied at the same time to the BBC for the job of reporter/ presenter on BBC Scotland's current affairs programme called ""Current Account"".  The applicant received an interview but was not offered the job.  After many weeks, believing she would not receive the job, she accepted in January 1977 the offer of a job as a journalist for the Daily Express in London.   The applicant was subsequently informed by letter from the BBC dated 7 March 1977 that she had not been selected for the job. Before she left Scotland, Mr.  Alastair Hetherington, former Controller of BBC Scotland, asked the applicant why she had not taken the job with the BBC.  On being told the job had not been offered to her, Mr.  Hetherington disclosed that her appointment had been recommended by the interviewing Board in Scotland.  Afterwards, the Head of BBC Personnel in Scotland telephoned the applicant to offer her the job and apologised for the delay.  However, the applicant by that time had accepted a job in London with the Daily Express and had to decline.  She duly took the job in London but it proved unsatisfactory and she left after six months and joined the Sunday Times. In the summer of 1985, the applicant was questioned by journalists from the Observer concerning her application for the BBC job in 1976.  On reading an article in the Observer of 18 August 1985 entitled ""How MI5 vets BBC staff"", she discovered the details of what had occurred in 1976.  The content of the article has been confirmed as accurate by Mr.  Alastair Hetherington, now a Research Professor at the University of Stirling.  He had not informed her previously because of the Official Secrets Act 1911. The applicant alleges that the events surrounding her job application were as follows.  In late 1976 the interview board had unanimously decided that the applicant was the best candidate and should be offered the job.  The decision was referred to London, where the News and Current Affairs Division had a right of veto and where applications had to go through a security check.  Mr.  Hetherington, who has submitted an affidavit which supports in some particulars the applicant's version of events, but provides no dates of the relevant events under dispute, states that ""although I cannot recall the exact timing of events in respect of Ms Hilton's application, I have no reason to believe that there was any unusual delay in referring her particulars to the Personnel Department in London.""  He states that he was subsequently informed by a senior official of the Personnel Directorate ""approximately a week after the referral had been made to London"" that the appointment of the applicant could not go ahead. This was confirmed several days later by a security liaison officer - a BBC employee.  He insisted, however, that the security liaison officer should explain the reason for this and was finally told three to four weeks later that the applicant was refused because she had been the Secretary of a suspect organisation associated with China. After enquiries, Mr.  Hetherington was of the opinion that the security personnel had confused the university organisation with which the applicant was associated with another association considered suspect.  He informed the security officer of this serious mistake and after further delay, he was informed it was permissible to offer the applicant the job.  However, by that time (January 1977), the applicant had accepted a job with a London newspaper.  She resigned as Secretary of the Scotland-China Association in February 1977. The applicant states that at no time did any person in authority inform her that information relevant to security was obtained, retained and used in relation to her job application and at no time was she given an opportunity to know the contents of that information so that its accuracy could be checked.  She believes that the security procedures applied by the BBC are carried out by, or at the insistence of, the Security Services of the United Kingdom and she may in the future wish to apply for a job with the BBC. She stresses that while she is uncertain as to the precise dates of the relevant events, she is certain that she accepted the offer of the job as a journalist in London in January 1977 because she knew that she would not be appointed to the BBC Scotland job. The respondent Government accept that the applicant was subject to a security check but state that it was only on 14 February 1977 that the BBC made enquiries of the Security Service in respect of her candidature by which date the applicant had accepted alternative employment.  The Security Service, according to the Government, responded to the BBC's enquiry on 16 March 1977 after the applicant had accepted alternative employment.  The Government also point out that the Security Service assessment of the applicant provided to the BBC was not based upon a confusion between the Scotland-China Association and any other organisation.  The assessment concluded by advising against offering the applicant the job unless the BBC were to decide that there were good reasons for doing otherwise.  They state that it was at all times exclusively for the BBC to decide what attitude to take in the light of the Security assessment.  On 21 April 1977 the Security Service advised that since the applicant was no longer the Secretary of the Scotland-China Association, she should not be debarred from working for the BBC. The Government state that the applicant has been informed by the BBC in a letter dated 2 December 1985 that no files exist concerning the events she complains of.  Furthermore, as a result of discussions with trade union representatives, the BBC agreed to destroy files and other materials concerning security matters after a period of two years which might have existed in respect of current and previous members of staff.  The only file now held by the BBC referring to the applicant is a programme contracts file which contains only copies of contributors' contracts. The applicant, however, notes that the BBC's letter only relates to files kept about her by the BBC.  She believes that files are kept about her by the Security Service and points out that the BBC's letter did not concern the existence of such files.  She states that this is a matter of continuing concern to her since as a freelance journalist who works occasionally for the BBC she may be subject to prejudice as a result of files relating to her kept by the Security Service. COMPLAINTS The applicant complains that the obtaining, retention and application of personal information by the BBC and the Security Service so as adversely to affect her prospects of being appointed to a particular post, without any opportunity for her to know or to comment on the accuracy of the information, constitutes a breach of her right under Article 8 (Art. 8) of the Convention to respect for her private life.  She claims that as a result of not being offered the job with the BBC she suffered personal financial loss and disruption to her personal and professional life in Scotland. She further complains, in the following terms, of the continuing retention and potential use of such information: ""Ms.  Hilton believes that the BBC continues to operate security 'procedures' of the sort applied to her in 1976.  She has, without success, asked the BBC to give her access to any and all files held concerning her so that she can check the accuracy of the information. ... Ms.  Hilton believes that the 'security procedures' applied by the BBC are carried out by, or at the insistence of, the Security Service of the United Kingdom Government."" She submits that these measures are not ""in accordance with the law"" as required by Article 8 para. 2 (Art. 8-2) since the relevant law (if any) is not adequately accessible or formulated with sufficient precision.  The applicant also argues that the post in question had no implications for national security and therefore could not be justified under this provision as being in the interests of national security.  Further, there were no safeguards applied to ensure the ""procedures"" operated fairly and effectively. The applicant also claims that she has no effective remedy before a national authority in respect of the matters of which she complains.  She accordingly invokes Article 13 in conjunction with Article 8 (Art. 13 + Art. 8) of the Convention. The applicant, in her observations in reply dated 12 June 1987 and 29 January 1988, further complains under Article 10 (Art. 10) of the Convention.  She contends that the refusal to appoint her because of her association with the Scotland-China Association amounts to a penalty for the expression of her views.  She further submits that the Security Service interfered with her right to impart information and ideas to the public by advising that she should not be employed as a reporter.  Finally, she submits that the continuing situation created by the practice and procedure of the obtaining, retention and potential use of information about her private life by the Security Service constitutes a breach of Article 10 (Art. 10) of the Convention. OBJECT OF THE APPLICATION The applicant's object is: (1) to obtain a finding by the organs established under the Convention that she is a victim of a violation of Articles 8 and 13 (Art. 8, Art. 13) of the Convention; (2) to obtain confirmation that no data concerning her private activities are retained by the BBC or, if they are, to know the contents of such data so that she can check their accuracy. PROCEEDINGS BEFORE THE COMMISSION The application was introduced on 7 February 1986 and registered on 26 February 1986.  It was first considered by the Commission on 18 July 1986 when it was decided that the Government should be invited to submit written observations on the admissibility and merits of the application insofar as it raised issues under Articles 8 and 13 (Art. 8, Art. 13) of the Convention.  These observations were submitted by the respondent Government on 9 February 1987.  The applicant's observations in reply were submitted on 12 June 1987. By a decision of 28 October 1987 the President of the Commission granted a request from the respondent Government to submit further observations  in respect of the issues raised in the application.  These further observations were submitted on 26 November 1987 and were communicated to the applicant for observations in reply. The applicant's observations in reply were submitted on 29 January 1988 and a supporting affidavit was further submitted on 19 February 1988. SUBMISSIONS OF THE PARTIES Respondent Government As to Fact The Government note the applicant's claim that the check by the Security Service took place prior to the applicant's accepting alternative employment.  They make the following observations with reference to the applicant's submissions on this issue:- - a possible explanation for the BBC's delay in contacting the Security Service after the applicant had been selected by the Board in late 1976 may be the fact that, on a previous application by the applicant for an appointment with the BBC, the BBC had obtained in December 1975 an assessment from the Security Service to the effect that there were no security considerations against offering the applicant the job.  The fact remains that it was not until February 1977 that the BBC made enquiries of the Security Service and the Service responded to the enquiry on 16 March 1977; - the BBC's letter of 7 March 1977 merely informed the applicant that she had not been selected for the job and gave no reason for rejecting her application.  The letter does not show that the assessment by the Security Service must have occurred at an earlier date; - the Government are unable to comment on the recollection of Mr.  Hetherington or of the applicant as to when either was told of the reasons for her non-appointment, save to repeat that it was not until 16 March 1977 that the Security Service responded to the BBC's request for an assessment; - the Government do not accept that there is any inconsistency between the account of the facts given by the Government and the applicant's claim to have resigned from the Scotland-China Association in February 1977; - the first request made by the BBC to the Security Service in relation to the applicant's job application in 1976 was made in February 1977.  No prior requests of an oral or written nature were made and no response to the request, whether written or oral, was given by the Security Service prior to 16 March 1977. Domestic law and practice The BBC is an independent corporate body which was incorporated by Royal Charter granted in exercise of the Royal Prerogative on 20 December 1926.  The objects of the BBC include the provision of radio and television broadcasting services (Article 3 (a)) and, for this purpose, the BBC is empowered to acquire from the Secretary of State a licence for such period subject to such terms as he might prescribe.   The conduct of the Corporation's affairs is the responsibility of the Governors who are, by Article 1 of the Charter, expressed to be members of the Corporation. The status under domestic law of the BBC was fully considered by the Court of Appeal in the case of British Broadcasting Corporation v.  Johns [1965] 1 Ch. 32 in which the Court was required to determine whether the BBC was an instrument of Government which was entitled to the immunities and privileges of the Crown, in particular, in relation to taxation.  The Court of Appeal concluded that the BBC was not a servant or agent of the Crown and did not enjoy any of the privileges or immunities of the Crown.  The reasons of the Court can be summarised as follows: -      neither the Crown nor Parliament had asserted a monopoly over broadcasting or asserted that it should be within the province, or a function, of Government; -      in determining how broadcasting should be regulated, Parliament had specifically chosen not to make it a function of Government by, for instance, imposing a duty on a Government Minister to organise a broadcasting service. Instead the BBC had been created by Charter and had been given an independent legal personality which was licensed to carry out a broadcasting service.  The BBC had been deliberately incorporated in the form in which it was created because it was considered to be in the public interest that broadcasting should not be conducted by a Government agency; -      the mere fact that the BBC was created by Charter does not make the Corporation an agent of the Crown.  There was nothing in the terms of the BBC's Charter to constitute the BBC as such an agent.  Equally, the licence and agreement was drafted so as to make clear that broadcasting services were to be provided by the BBC as an independent contractor and not as a Government agent; -      although the licence and agreement contained provisions under which the Postmaster-General could exercise control over the stations and transmissions of the BBC in their technical aspects, the general conduct and operation of broadcasting remained free from the control of the Government. The system of carrying out security checks on BBC employees in respect of employees was introduced in 1937.  Their purpose was to protect the BBC from penetration by those who might pose a threat to security and to safeguard official classified information held by the BBC.  The Security Service provides a service to the BBC in connection with these checks. At the time of the applicant's application for employment the security vetting procedures were applied to current affairs staff on the ground of the overriding requirement to preserve the impartiality and integrity of the BBC's News Service.  However, consistently with the provisions of the BBC's Charter (Article 12) (Art. 12) it is the BBC which decides whom to appoint to any post or whether to invoke a security checks procedure.  Neither the Security Service nor any other external agency has the right of veto on the appointment or promotion of any member of staff.  The BBC's security officer, who implements the procedure and liaises with the Security Service, is a BBC employee who is responsible only to BBC management. In October 1985 the criteria for invoking the checks were revised to apply only to members of the staff who were necessarily involved in sensitive areas who required access to official classified information.  In the domestic services they now apply only to staff involved in the planning and preparation of the war-time broadcasting service and who therefore have access to official classified information. The six months rule (Article 26  of the Convention) (Art. 26) The Government contend that the applicant raises for the first time in her reply to the Government's observations the following complaints: -      that the role of the Security Service in 1976-1977 in relation to her job application constituted a breach of Article 8 of the Convention (Art. 8) ; -      that the Government had failed to fulfil the positive obligations inherent in effective respect for the rights guaranteed by Article 8 (Art. 8); -      that there was a breach of Article 10 (Art. 10) of the Convention in her case in that she was being penalised for expressing her views in circumstances which could not be justified under the second paragraph of this provision. The Government submit that, while the six months rule could be held to be satisfied in relation to the complaint in the original application which was directed exclusively to the acts of the BBC, it is not met by the above new complaints. Article 8 (Art. 8) of the Convention The Government submit that there is no factual basis on which the applicant can complain that the obtaining, retention or application of information about her adversely affected her prospects in her application to the BBC.  They point out that the applicant had accepted alternative employment before any security checks had even been initiated by the BBC.  Moreover, there is no factual basis for the complaint as to the continuing retention of information about her by the BBC since she has been informed that all of the information gathered about her has since been destroyed. It is further submitted that, in any event, the acts of the BBC do not engage the responsibility of the United Kingdom Government under the Convention.  The BBC enjoys a separate legal personality and autonomy of administration and management and is not a department of Government.  The Government refer to the analysis of the status of the BBC by the Court of Appeal in the Johns case (loc. cit.). In particular, the control and management of the BBC is vested by the Charter in the Governors of the Corporation who are appointed by the Queen-in-council and do not perform their duties as servants or agents of the State.  Furthermore, the Governors' managerial functions are carried out wholly independently of Government control. The respondent Government thus submit that this complaint should be rejected as incompatible with the Convention ratione personae or alternatively should be dismissed as manifestly ill-founded. Article 10 (Art. 10) of the Convention The Government state that the applicant has at all times been free to hold and express opinions, whether of a political nature or otherwise, and has not substantiated her complaint under this provision.  No evidence has been adduced to show that the provision of information to the BBC by the Security Service concerning the applicant's membership of the Scotland-China Association was aimed at penalising the applicant for exercising her right to express opinions. Article 13 (Art. 13) of the Convention It is submitted that the applicant's claim of a breach of Article 8 (Art. 8) in respect of the acts of the BBC is incompatible with the Convention ratione personae or, alternatively, the claim is manifestly ill-founded.  It follows that the applicant has no arguable claim to be a victim of a violation by the Government of this provision. Accordingly, Article 13 (Art. 13) of the Convention is inapplicable in respect of this complaint. The Applicant As to Fact The applicant disputes the Government's contention that the BBC's enquiries to the Security Services were made after the applicant had accepted alternative employment.  She points out that -      she was selected by the Board for the job in late 1976 and there is no explanation for the delay until March 1977; -      the BBC wrote to the applicant on 7 March 1977 informing her that she had not been selected for the job.  The relevant letter shows that the vetting by the Security Services must have occurred at an earlier date; -      Mr.  Alastair Hetherington (then Controller of BBC Scotland) recalls that he was told of the security reasons for her non-appointment soon after the referral of the interviewing board's decision for clearance to the Personnel Department in London; -      the Government fail to provide an explanation why the Security Service gave further consideration to the matter.  The true reason lies in Mr.  Hetherington's protests.  Moreover it is possible that oral requests had been made to the Security Service prior to the first written request; -      the reason relied on by the Security Service, namely the applicant's position in the Scotland-China Association pre-dates March 1977 since she resigned from that Association in February 1977. With respect to the Government claim that the Security Service advised against appointment because of her association with the Scotland-China Association, the applicant submits that either this was a perverse decision since there was no reason whatsoever for suspecting the bona fides of a person because of contact with that organisation or the Security Service confused that organisation with another organisation. The Scotland-China Association was formed in 1966 and involves many eminent persons and Chinese scholars.  The Association never adopted any political position on events in China and did not accept funds from the Chinese Government. Six months rule As regards the applicant's complaints of the obtaining, retention and application of such information by the BBC and the Security Service in 1976 to 1977 she could not have been aware of the practice and procedure as applied to her until she read the article in the Observer of 18 August 1985.  The applicant submits that the time does not run for the purposes of Article 26 (Art. 26) until the victim of an alleged violation becomes aware or should reasonably be aware of the taking of the final decision.  Accordingly, the relevant date for the purposes of Article 26 (Art. 26) is the date of the Observer article, i.e. 18 August 1985. As far as the applicant complains of the still continuing situation created by the practice and procedure of obtaining and retaining information about her private life by the Security Service as being contrary to Article 10 (Art. 10), the six months rule is irrelevant. Insofar as the applicant complains of the obtaining, retention and application of information by the BBC and the Security Service in 1976 to 1977, the applicant accepts that she did not specifically complain in her original application of a breach of Article 10 (Art. 10).  However, she does not seek to rely on any additional facts.  She maintains that the same facts constitute a violation of Article 8 (Art. 8) as well as Article 10 (Art. 10).  Moreover, it was not until she became aware of the contents of the Government's observations that she knew that the reason for the adverse reports upon her by the Security Service was alleged to be to satisfy ""the overriding requirement to preserve the impartiality and integrity of the BBC's News Service"". The applicant was entitled to complain of a breach of Article 10 (Art. 10) based partly on information disclosed for the first time in the Government's observations. Article 8 (Art. 8) of the Convention To the extent that the substance of the applicant's complaint relates to the actions of the BBC it is submitted that such actions engage the responsibility of the Government by virtue of the positive obligations inherent in an effective respect for private life.  Such actions also engage the responsibility of the United Kingdom for the following reasons: (1) the practice of carrying out security checks on BBC employees, and the procedures relating thereto, have been agreed at a senior level in the Home Office, the Security Service and the BBC so as to give effect to the ""overriding requirement to preserve the impartiality and integrity of the BBC's News Service""; (2) the relevant practice and procedures applied to the BBC as one of the country's most important public institutions in relation to the provision in the public interest of public service broadcasting; (3) although the BBC enjoys a separate legal personality and an autonomy of administration, it has been entrusted by the Secretary of State with the performance of public functions, subject to conditions prescribed by the Secretary of State, on behalf of the United Kingdom; (4) the character of the BBC as a public authority is further evidenced by a clause 13.7 of the current BBC licence which contains the following proviso: ""The Corporation shall at all times refrain from sending any broadcasting matter expressing the opinion of the Corporation on current affairs or matters of public policy"" and by the fact that a resolution by the Board of Governors of the BBC, annexed to the licence, reaffirms the Board's objectives ""to treat controversial subjects with due impartiality and they intend to continue this policy both in the Corporation's News Service and in the more general field of programmes dealing with matters of public policy""; (5) the duties imposed upon the BBC by these provisions are similar to the duties imposed upon the other main broadcasting body of the United Kingdom - the Independent Broadcasting Authority (IBA) which is obliged by Section 4(1) of the Broadcasting Act 1981 to comply with the requirement that a sufficient amount of time in the programmes is given to news and news features and that all news given in the programmes is presented with due accuracy and impartiality.  Moreover, the fact that the BBC's public duties are prescribed by the Secretary of State, whereas the IBA's public duties are prescribed by Parliament does not affect the ""public"" character of the BBC for the purposes of the United Kingdom's obligations under the Convention; (6) the public character of both the BBC and the IBA is further evidenced by the fact that each is a ""broadcasting body"" as defined by Section 54(3) of the Broadcasting Act 1981 complaints about whose allegedly unjust or unfair treatment or unwarranted infringements of privacy in sound or television broadcasts are considered and adjudicated upon by the Broadcasting Complaints Commission under Section 54 of that Act; (7) the courts of the United Kingdom have decided that, in determining whether the decisions of a particular body were subject to judicial review, the court was not confined to considering the source of that body's powers and duties but could also look at their nature. Accordingly, if a duty imposed on a body, whether expressly or by implication, was a public duty, the body was exercising public law functions and a court had jurisdiction to entertain an application for judicial review. (See R. v.  Broadcasting Complaints Commission, ex parte Owen [1985] 2 All ER 522 (Divisional Court) and R. v.  Panel on Take-overs and Mergers, ex parte Datafin [1987] 1 All ER 564 (Court of Appeal); (8) the case of British Broadcasting Corporation v.  Johns [1965] 1 Ch. 32, merely decided that the BBC is not the servant or agent of the Crown and does not enjoy the privileges and immunities of the Crown.  The Johns case did not decide that the BBC was immune to judicial review as a public law body, still less that it is not a public authority; (9) the Court of Justice of the European Communities has recently examined whether the Chief Constable of the Royal Ulster Constabulary was a public authority so as to be bound by the principle of equal treatment for men and women guaranteed by Council Directive No. 76/207/EEC of 9 February 1976.  The Government had argued that the Chief Constable is constitutionally independent of the State and that in the particular case he was involved only as an employer.  The Court of Justice found that whatever the relationship of the Chief Constable might be with other organs of the State ""such a pubic authority, charged by the State with the maintenance of public order and safety, does not act as a private individual.  It may not take advantage of the failure of the State, of which it is an emanation, to comply with community law."" The applicant contends that this principle applies mutatis mutandis in relation to compliance with the law of the Convention by the BBC.  The BBC is a public authority charged by the Secretary of State with the performance of public service broadcasting functions. The applicant's complaints are directed against the BBC in its capacity as a public authority and not as a private employer performing exclusively private functions. The applicant recalls that, to the extent that the Security Service was responsible for the matters she complains of, her complaint is directed to the acts of the Security Service for which the Government are clearly responsible.  She submits that the obtaining, retention and use of personal information about her without having an opportunity to refute it amounts to an interference with her right to respect for private life as guaranteed by Article 8 para. 1 (Art. 8-1) of the Convention (Eur.  Court H.R., Leander judgment of 26 March 1987, Series A no. 116, p. 22 para. 48).  She further claims that the obtaining, retaining and use of such information did adversely affect her prospects of obtaining employment because they resulted in a negative assessment by the Security Service and a long delay after she had been interviewed by the BBC Scotland.  The applicant would have preferred to work for the BBC in Scotland both because of the nature of the work and because she wished to remain in Scotland. She further submits that obtaining and continuing retention of such personal information about her is not ""in accordance with the law"" as required by Article 8 para. 2 (Art. 8-2) of the Convention (see p. 23 para. 51 of the Leander case, loc. cit.).  She also contends that the interference with her respect for private life was not necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security and that it did not correspond to a pressing social need and was not proportionate to any legitimate aim pursued.  Moreover, there exist no adequate and effective safeguards against abuse under the law of the United Kingdom.  She maintains that these submissions have not been addressed by the respondent Government in their observations and that the Government's submissions are silent as to whether such a file of personal information is held by the Security Service. Article 10 (Art. 10) of the Convention It is submitted that the Security Service interferes with the applicant's right to impart information and ideas to the public by advising that she should not be employed as a reporter/presenter in current affairs programmes.  The BBC further interfered with her right to impart information and ideas to the public by accepting the advice of the Security Service.  Unlike the position in the Leander case, the practices and procedures complained of were concerned with the content of the information and ideas imparted by the BBC to the public and the Security Service's view that someone like the applicant should not be concerned with such communication.  Accordingly, an interference with the exercise of freedom of expression by journalists rather than access to the public service is at the heart of this issue. Article 13 (Art. 13) of the Convention It is submitted that the applicant's claims of breaches of Articles 8 and 10 (Art. 8, Art. 10) are arguable and give rise to prima facie issues under the Convention.  The absence of effective remedies before a national authority is a central element in the applicant's complaint to the Commission. THE LAW 1.      The applicant complains of the obtaining and application of personal information about her by the BBC and the Security Service. She further complains of the continued retention of such information. In particular, she complains that the information on file about her personal background was used to deny her a job as a reporter with the BBC in Scotland in 1977.  She invokes Articles 8, 10 and 13 (Art. 8, Art. 10, Art. 13) of the Convention. Six months rule (Article 26 of the Convention) (Art. 26) The respondent Government first submit that the applicant raised the following aspects of her complaint for the first time in her reply dated 12 June 1987 to the Government's observations and that they should be rejected on the basis of the six month rule having regard to the date of the introduction of the application (7 February 1986): 1.  that the role of the Security Service in carrying out the Security check in 1976-1977 constituted a breach of Article 8 (Art. 8); 2.  that the Government had failed to fulfil the positive obligation inherent in Article 8 (Art. 8); 3.  that she was, in effect, penalised for the 'expression' of her views in breach of Article 10 (Art. 10). The Government note that the 'final decision', for the purposes of Article 26 (Art. 26), is the obtaining from the Security Service and alleged use by the BBC of personal information concerning the applicant in relation to her application for employment by the BBC in 1976-1977. The above submissions are made on the assumption that Article 26 (Art. 26) could be held to be satisfied, having regard to the fact that the applicant claims to have discovered the facts relating to the security check on her background in the article in the Observer newspaper of 18 August 1985. Article 26 (Art. 26) of the Convention reads as follows: ""The Commission may only deal with the matter after all domestic remedies have been exhausted, according to the generally recognised rules of international law, and within a period of six months from the date on which the final decision was taken."" The Commission notes that in accordance with constant case-law the 'final decision' for purposes of the six months rule must normally be regarded as the date of the acts or decisions complained of where there exists no domestic remedy in respect of the complaint (see No. 8206/78, Dec. 10.7.81, D.R. 25 p. 147).  The Commission further recalls that the six months rule contained in this provision does not apply to a complaint which concerns a continuing situation (see No. 6852/76, Dec. 5.12.78, D.R. 15 p. 5).  Finally, the Commission observes that the running of the six months period might be interrupted or suspended by the existence of special circumstances and, in any event, can only begin to run from the moment the applicant learns of the act or decision of the public authority of which he complains (see No. 9991/82, Dec. 12.7.84, D.R. 39 p. 147). In the present case, it is not disputed by the respondent Government that there is no remedy under the law of the United Kingdom in respect of the matters complained of.  It follows, therefore, that the final decision for purposes of Article 26 (Art. 26) in respect of the applicant's complaint concerning the compilation and use of personal information about her in 1976-1977 must relate back to the acts of the BBC and the Security Service in 1977.  However, the Commission notes that it is not disputed by the Government that the applicant first learned that a security check had been carried out in respect of her candidature for a post in the BBC in an article in the Observer newspaper on 18 August 1985.  In these circumstances, the Commission considers that the absence of knowledge on the applicant's part of the matters which form the subject of the complaint constitute special circumstances which interrupt the running of the six months period. The Commission further observes that the six months rule does not apply to that part of the applicant's complaint under Articles 8 and 10 (Art. 8, Art. 10) of the Convention which relates to the continued retention of personal information about the applicant since such a complaint concerns a continuing situation. The Commission accordingly finds that the six months period, where it applies, begins to run from 18 August 1985.  It must now turn to the Government's specific objections under this head as formulated above. As regards the first aspect mentioned by the Government, the Commission notes that the relevant part of the applicant's original memorial to the Commission reads as follows: ""(19) Ms.  Hilton believes that the security 'procedures' applied by the BBC are carried out by, or at the insistence of, the security services of the United Kingdom Government."" The Commission is therefore satisfied that the applicant had raised this complaint concerning the role of the Security Service at the outset of her application. As regards the second aspect, the Commission considers that this constitutes a legal submission in respect of the applicant's main complaint under Article 8 (Art. 8) of the Convention as opposed to the introduction of a new factual element in the case or a new head of complaint. Finally, as regards the third aspect, the Commission notes that the applicant's complaint under Article 10 (Art. 10) of the Convention was raised for the first time in her observations in reply dated 12 June 1987. However, the Commission observes that this complaint was based on the facts of the case as set out in the original memorial to the Commission.  It is not based on additional factual material introduced for the first time in the applicant's observations in reply. The Commission recalls, in this context, that ""Article 25 (Art. 25) requires that individual applicants should claim to be the victim 'of a violation of the rights set forth in the Convention';  it does not oblige them to specify which Article, paragraph or sub-paragraph or even which right they are praying in aid"" (see Eur.  Court H.R., Guzzardi judgment of 6 November 1980, Series A no. 39, p. 22 para. 61). Moreover, the Commission and Court possess an inherent power to decide upon the characterisation in law to be given to a matter (loc. cit., at p. 23 para. 63). It follows, therefore, that it is open to an applicant to make new complaints based on the essential facts as originally presented, at a subsequent stage of the procedure, and that the six months rule is not opposable to such new complaints. The Commission concludes that the application, as a whole, satisfies the six months requirement in Article 26 (Art. 26) of the Convention. 2.      Article 8 (Art. 8) of the Convention The Commission notes that the applicant's complaints under this head fall into two parts.  First, she complains that as a result of a security check carried out by the BBC and the Security Service based on personal information which had been compiled and retained about her and which she had no opportunity to refute she was denied a job with the BBC in 1977.   Second, she complains of the compilation, continued retention and potential use of personal information about her. The applicant submits that the compilation and use of information in 1977 and the continued retention of such information constitutes an interference with her right to respect for private life which is not ""in accordance with the law"" or justified under paragraph 2 of Article 8 (Art. 8). The Government do not contest that the applicant can claim to be a victim of a breach of this provision.  However, they contend that the applicant could not have been prejudiced by the security check which was carried out since she had accepted alternative employment in January 1977 before the BBC had requested a security check on 14 February 1977. They further submit that, in any event, the acts of the BBC do not engage the responsibility of the United Kingdom since it is not a department of Government.  Finally, they point out that there is no factual basis for her complaint as to the continuing retention of information by the BBC since she had been informed that the BBC has destroyed all of the information gathered about her.  In their submissions the Government do not address that aspect of the applicant's complaint relating to the continuing retention of information about her by the Security Service. The applicant maintains that the security check was carried out before February 1977 and that the reason she accepted the job in London was because she had been informed that her candidature with the BBC had been turned down.  She further submits that the BBC is a public authority for which there is state responsibility and that in any event the acts of the Security Service engage the responsibility of the respondent State. Article 8 (Art. 8) of the Convention provides as follows: ""1.      Everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life, his home and his correspondence. 2.      There shall be no interference by a public authority with the exercise of this right except such as is in accordance with the law and is necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security, public safety or the economic well-being of the country, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others."" A.      As regards the applicant's first complaint, the Commission notes that there is substantial disagreement between the parties as to when the request for a security check was actually made by the BBC. The applicant contends that she accepted the offer of the job as a journalist in London in January 1977 because she knew by that time that she was not successful in her job application to the BBC.  She admits, however, that she is uncertain as to the precise dates of the relevant events.  In support of her account of the facts she submits an affidavit sworn on 15 February 1988 by Mr.  Alastair Hetherington who was Controller of BBC Scotland during the relevant time. Mr.  Hetherington states in his affidavit that he has no reason to believe that there was any unusual delay in referring the applicant's ""particulars"" to the Personnel Department in London after the Interview Board's recommendation and that he was notified of the negative report and outcome within a week after the referral had been made to London.  On the other hand, he concedes that he cannot recall the exact timing of events and his affidavit mentions few dates in support of his recollection of the relevant events. The Government maintain that the enquiry of the security service by the BBC concerning the applicant was not made until 14 February 1977 by which date the applicant had accepted alternative employment.  They, therefore, contest that the applicant suffered any prejudice as a result of the Security Service check. The applicant points to a number of circumstantial elements which, she claims, support her contention.  She submits that the BBC letter of 7 March 1977 informing her that she had not been selected for the job shows that the Security Service check must have occurred at an earlier date.  However, this letter, which has been submitted to the Commission, merely informed the applicant that she had not been selected for the job and provides no indication of when a check occurred. She further suggests that the security check must have occurred at an earlier date since the reason relied on by the Security Services - the fact that she was Secretary to the Scotland-China Association - predates March 1977.  She had, in fact, resigned from the Association, in February 1977.  The Commission, however, agrees with the Government, that this is not inconsistent with the Government's claim that the request for a security check was made on 14 February 1977. The applicant further points out that she was recommended for the post in late 1976 but there is no explanation for the delay in contacting the Security Service and notifying her of the outcome until March 1977.  The Government provide the tentative explanation that the delay in contacting the Security Service may be explained by the fact that on a previous job application by the applicant the Security Service had advised that there were no security considerations against offering the applicant the job.  In any event the Commission cannot draw any firm conclusions from this delay as to the date of the request by the BBC to the Security Service. Finally, the applicant suggests that a previous oral request for security clearance may have been made prior to the written request.  She adds that the Government offer no explanation as to why the Security Service gave further consideration to the matter, submitting that the true reason lies in the protests by Mr.  Hetherington on behalf of the applicant.  The Government deny that any prior written or oral requests were made and explain that the reason for the further consideration of the matter lay in the fact that the applicant had resigned as Secretary of the Scotland-China Association.  In the light of her resignation, the BBC was advised on 26 April 1977 that the applicant should not necessarily be debarred from employment with the BBC. The Commission again sees no inconsistency between the Government's version of events and the further consideration of the applicant's position in the light of her resignation from the secretaryship of the Association. The Commission has had regard to the fact that the above factual dispute relates to events which occurred more than eleven years ago.  It is therefore not surprising that the recollection of the exact pattern of events is difficult.  Nevertheless against the above background, in particular, the admitted difficulty that the applicant and Mr.  Hetherington have of recalling the timing of events, the Commission finds that the applicant has not substantiated her claim that the security check took place before February 1977.  The Commission accepts, therefore, the Government's statement that the check was requested by the BBC on 14 February 1977 after the applicant had decided to accept an offer of employment with a newspaper in London. In the light of this finding the Commission considers that it is unnecessary to express a view on whether the acts of the BBC give rise to the responsibility of the United Kingdom under the Convention. It follows that the applicant's first complaint under this head that information concerning her personal background was used by the BBC and the Security Service to her detriment must be rejected as manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 27 para. 2 (Art. 27-2) of the Convention. B.      It remains to examine the applicant's more general complaint under this provision relating to her allegation concerning the compilation and continued retention of personal information about her by both the BBC and the Security Service The Commission does not consider that a security check per se constitutes an interference with the right to respect for private life guaranteed by this provision.  An interference with the right to respect for private life only occurs when security checks are based on information about a person's private affairs.  Moreover it is not necessary that the person actually show that such information has been used to his detriment (See Eur.  Court H.R., Leander judgment of 26 March 1987, Series A no. 116, p. 22 para. 48). In the present case the question arises whether the applicant has sufficiently proved the compilation and retention of such a dossier. As regards the BBC the Commission considers that there is no indication from the case-file that the information compiled by the BBC in respect of the applicant's job application in 1977 contained any material other than information contained in documents relating to her application for employment.  Moreover, it notes that the applicant has been informed by the BBC in a letter dated 2 December 1985 that no files exist in respect of her job application in 1977. In these circumstances the Commission does not consider that the applicant has substantiated her complaint under this provision in so far as it relates to the compilation and continued retention of personal information by the BBC. It follows that it is again not incumbent on the Commission to express a view on whether the acts of the BBC give rise to the responsibility of the United Kingdom under the Convention. With regard to the alleged continued retention of personal information by the Security Service, the Commission notes that this complaint has not been made expressis verbis by the applicant until her supplementary observations in reply dated 29 January 1988. The Government, in their submissions, have interpreted this complaint as relating to the continued retention of information by the BBC alone.  The Commission, nevertheless, considers that this complaint can be reasonably inferred from the applicant's general complaint relating to the continued retention of information made in her original application. In this connection the Commission considers that the applicant has not substantiated her allegation that the Security Service compiled and continue to maintain a file of personal information about her. However, the Commission recalls that ""an individual may, under certain conditions, claim to be the victim of a violation occasioned by the mere existence of secret measures ... without having to allege that such measures were in fact applied to him"" (Eur.  Court H.R., Klass judgment of 6 September 1978, Series A no. 28, p. 18, para. 34). The Court in the Klass case added that the relevant conditions were ""to be determined in each case according to the Convention right or right alleged to have been infringed, the secret character of the measures objected to, and the connection between the applicant and those measures"" (ibid.). This approach was followed by the Commission in a similar case against Luxembourg (See Nos. 10439-41/83, 10452/83, 10512-13/83, Dec. 10.5.85, to be published in D.R.). The Commission does not consider that this passage can be interpreted so broadly as to encompass every person in the United Kingdom who considers that the Security Service may have compiled information about them. The Commission considers that the Klass case falls to be distinguished from the present case in that there existed a legislative framework in that case which governed the use of secret measures and that this legislation potentially affected all users of postal and telecommunications services.  In the present case the category of persons likely to be affected by the measures in question is significantly narrower. On the other hand, the Commission considers that it should be possible in certain cases to raise a complaint such as is made by the applicant without the necessity of proving the existence of a file of personal information.  To fall into the latter category the Commission is of the opinion that applicants must be able to show that there is, at least, a reasonable likelihood that the Security Service has compiled and continues to retain personal information about them. In the present case the Commission recalls that the security check which is at the basis of the applicant's complaint occurred in 1977.  It is apparent that the Security Service recommended that the applicant not be eligible for appointment to the BBC because of her secretaryship of the Scotland-China Association.  Once the applicant ceased to be the Secretary to this Association the Security Service recommended that there were no further obstacles to her appointment. There is no indication that the Security Service then had or have retained any information of a personal character relating to the applicant.  The evidence is only to the effect that it was known that she was Secretary of the Scotland-China Association.  The Commission has not been apprised of any reason since that date as to why the Security Service should continue to show further interest in the applicant.  Nor is there any indication that the applicant, as a journalist, or in any other capacity, belongs to a category of persons that might be the subject of such interest.  The Commission recalls that the only reason for her present fears lies in the Observer Newspaper report of 18 August 1985 which informed her for the first time of the security check in 1977.  The Commission is therefore of the opinion that the applicant has not shown that there is at least a reasonable likelihood that the Secret Service has compiled and continues to retain personal information about her. The Commission concludes that there has been no interference with the applicant's right to respect for private life since she has not substantiated her allegation.  It follows that that the above complaint must also be rejected as manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 27 para. 2 (Art. 27-2) of the Convention. 3.      Article 10 (Art. 10) of the Convention The applicant complains under this provision that the refusal to appoint her to the BBC job constitutes, in effect, a penalty for the expression of her views.  She further complains that by advising that she should not be employed as a reporter, the Security Service interfered with her right to impart information and ideas to the public.  She has also suggested, in her submissions, that a further Article 10 (Art. 10) issue arises in respect of the continuing situation created by the practice and procedure of the obtaining, retention and potential use of information about her private life by the Security Service. She has not elaborated her complaint in this respect. Article 10 (Art. 10) of the Convention provides as follows: ""1.   Everyone has the right to freedom of expression.  This right shall include freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public authority and regardless of frontiers. ... 2.  The exercise of these freedoms, since it carries with it duties and responsibiities, may be subject to such formalities, conditions, restrictions or penalties as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society, in the interests of national security, territorial integrity or public safety, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, for the protection of the reputation or rights of others, for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence, or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary."" The Commission recalls that it has rejected as inadmissible for non-substantiation, the applicant's complaint that she failed to secure the BBC job because of the negative report from the Security Service as well as her allegations concerning the continuing retention and potential use of personal information by the Security Service.  It follows that the above complaints which are founded on the same allegation must also be dismissed on the same basis.  These complaints must therefore be rejected as manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 27 para. 2 (Art. 27-2) of the Convention. 4.      Article 13 (Art. 13) of the Convention The applicant complains under this provision that she lacks an effective remedy under the law of the United Kingdom in respect of her complaints.  This provision states as follows: ""Everyone whose rights and freedoms as set forth in this Convention are violated shall have an effective remedy before a national authority notwithstanding that the violation has been committed by persons acting in an official capacity."" The Commission recalls that for Article 13 (Art. 13) to apply the claim that a provision of the Convention has been breached must be an 'arguable' one. The Commission notes that it has rejected the applicant's complaints under Articles 8 and 10 (Art. 8, Art. 10) of the Convention on the basis that she has not substantiated her allegations of an interference with these rights.  In such circumstances the Commission does not consider that the applicant's claims can be described as 'arguable' (see, in this context, Eur. Court H.R., Boyle and Rice judgment of 27 April 1980, paras. 51 - 86;  and Plattform ""Ärzte für das Leben"" judgment of 21 June 1988, paras. 24 - 39). It follows that this complaint must be rejected as manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 27 para. 2 (Art. 27-2) of the Convention. For these reasons, the Commission DECLARES THE APPLICATION INADMISSIBLE. Secretary to the Commission          President of the Commission (H.C. KRÜGER)                       (C.A. NØRGAARD)",,

KRÜGER Secretary to the Commission Having regard to Article 25 (Art. 25) of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms; Having regard to: -       the Commission's decision of 2 December 1986 to bring the application to the notice of the respondent Government and invite them to submit written observations on its admissibility and merits; - ii - -       the observations submitted by the respondent Government on 4 March 1987 and the observations in reply submitted by the applicant on 15 May 1987; -       the Report of April 1988 provided for in Rule 40 of the Rules of Procedure of the Commission; Having deliberated; Decides as follows: THE FACTS The facts of the case, as they have been submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows: The applicant is a Dutch citizen, born in 1963.  In the proceedings before the Commission he is represented by Mrs.  G.E.M. Later, a lawyer practising in the Hague. On 15 December 1981, the applicant was convicted of armed robbery and homicide and sentenced to four years' imprisonment by the Regional Court (Arrondissementsrechtbank) of the Hague.  The Court further ordered that the applicant be placed at the Government's disposal subsequent to his prison sentence. While serving his prison sentence, the applicant escaped on several occasions and, in total, spent several months outside detention.  After having served two-thirds of his sentence, he was released on probation on 3 May 1984.  Thereafter he was detained at the Government's disposal in a psychiatric hospital. It appears that on 29 November 1985 the applicant ran away from the psychiatric hospital where he was being treated. On 4 December 1985, the Public Prosecutor requested the Regional Court of the Hague that the applicant's placement at the Government's disposal be prolonged for two years.  Neither the applicant nor his lawyer were informed of this request. On 18 December 1985, the applicant's lawyer wrote to the hospital's director requesting that the applicant's money be transferred to her account.  On the same day, the applicant's lawyer requested the Minister of Justice that the applicant should no longer be placed at the Government's disposal. When the applicant contacted the psychiatric hospital by telephone on 19 January 1986, he was informed that, on 7 January 1986, his placement at the Government's disposal had been prolonged for two years by the Regional Court of the Hague. After reporting back to the psychiatric hospital, the applicant has been detained since 22 February 1986, on the basis of that prolongation decision. In a letter of 20 August 1986, the Deputy Minister of Justice informed the applicant's lawyer that the applicant's placement at the Government's disposal would not cease for the time being.  This letter was received by the lawyer on 26 August 1986. COMPLAINTS The applicant complains that neither he nor his lawyer were heard by the Regional Court of the Hague when it had to decide on the prolongation of the applicant's placement at the Government's disposal.  The application submits that all authorities concerned were aware that he was represented by a lawyer.  The applicant alleges a violation of Article 5 para. 1 (a) alternatively para. 1 (e) (Art. 5-1-a) (Art.5-1-e), of the Convention. The applicant further complains that neither he nor his lawyer were informed of the request for prolongation of his placement at the Government's disposal, and he alleges a violation of Article 5 para. 2 (Art. 5-2) of the Convention in this respect. In addition, the applicant complains that he did not have the possibility of challenging the legality of his placement at the Government's disposal.  The sole possibility open to him was to request the Minister of Justice to order that he be no longer placed at the Government's disposal.  Such a request was made on 18 December 1985 and rejected by letter of 20 August 1986.  The applicant alleges a violation of Article 5 para. 4 (Art. 5-4) of the Convention in this respect. Moreover, the applicant complains that since he was not informed of the proceedings concerning the prolongation of his placement at the Government's disposal, he did not have a fair trial and he alleges a violation of Article 6 para. 1 (Art. 6-1) of the Convention. The applicant also claims that the proceedings concerning the prolongation of his placement at the Government's disposal were the consequence, and the continuation, of the determination of a criminal charge against him.  He complains that as he was unaware of the proceedings instituted against him, he was not given the opportunity of preparing his defence, and that he could not be assisted by a lawyer.  Accordingly, he alleges a violation of Article 6 para. 3 (Art. 6-3) of the Convention. Furthermore, the applicant complains that since no appeal is possible against the decision of the Regional Court to prolong his placement at the Government's disposal it will take two years before the case can again be brought before a court, by way of a request for prolongation.  The applicant submits that this constitutes a violation of Article 5 para. 4 (Art. 5-4) of the Convention, read in conjunction with Article 6 para. 1 (Art. 5-4 + Art. 6-1) of the Convention. Finally, the applicant claims that since he has been detained in contravention of Article 5 (Art. 5) of the Convention, he is entitled to compensation under Article 5 para. 5 (Art. 5-5) of the Convention. PROCEEDINGS BEFORE THE COMMISSION The application was introduced on 13 June 1986 and registered on 20 June 1986. On 2 December 1986 the Commission decided to invite the respondent Government, pursuant to Rule 42 para. 2 (b) of its Rules of Procedure, to submit written observations on admissibility and merits before 6 March 1987. The Government's observations were submitted on 4 March 1987 and the applicant's observations in reply on 15 May 1987. On 13 March 1987 the Commission decided that the applicant be granted legal aid. SUBMISSIONS OF THE PARTIES A.      The Government&S 1.      On the facts National legislation Placement at the Government's disposal is based on Section 37 (b) of the Dutch Penal Code (Wetboek van Strafrecht).  A period of placement lasts two years and then may be prolonged. Placement begins from the moment at which the judge's decision becomes final, but does not run while the person concerned is otherwise in detention (see para. 2 of Section 37 (b) Penal Code).  A prolongation of the placement is decided upon by the original sentencing court upon an application made by the Public Prosecutor between one and two months prior to the expiration of the current period of placement. The application must be accompanied by a statement concerning the physical and mental condition of the person, as well as a signed, reasoned statement by the consulting psychiatrist concerning the desirability of continued placement. In accordance with the Penal Code and the instructions of the Minister of Justice (by circular of 16 April 1980), the judge must allow the person concerned an opportunity to be heard before taking a decision on the prolongation.  The person may be summoned to appear before the court and the Public Prosecutor, as well as the lawyer of the person concerned, may be present at the hearing.  A decision on prolongation for one or two years is to be taken within two months of the public prosecution's application.  This decision is not open to appeal. The facts of the case To arrive at the date on which the applicant's first two-year period of placement at the Government's disposal terminated, it is necessary to take into account the following facts. The applicant was sentenced on 15 December 1981, the sentence became final on 30 December 1981.  At that moment the four-year prison term began.  After having served two thirds of this sentence the applicant could be released on probation.  Because he had escaped on several occasions, and the serving of a sentence is suspended while the prisoner is fugitive, the periods of time not spent in prison were added on to his sentence.  This amounted to 109 days.  He received a supplementary punishment of twenty-nine days.  The result was that the two-thirds of his sentence terminated on 3 May 1984, when he was released on probation, by decision of the Deputy Minister of Justice of 1 May 1984. The period of placement at the Government's disposal begins on the date the judge's decision becomes final.  It is suspended only by any period of time spent in detention on remand or while serving a prison sentence.  Therefore, every period of time when the applicant had escaped and his prison sentence was suspended, he is to be considered as having been at the Government's disposal.  When he was released on probation on 3 May 1984 his placement at the Government's disposal automatically began.  However, as his fugitive periods are also considered as placement at the Government's disposal, on 3 May 1984 he had, in fact, already  been in placement for 109 days.  As a result, the expiration date of his first two years of placement was not 3 May 1986, but 14 January 1986.  A letter stating this was sent to the Public Prosecutors and the hospital directors concerned. During the applicant's placement in the ""Dr.  H. van der Hoeven"" Clinic in Utrecht, he escaped on several occasions.  The last occasion was 29 November 1985.  He could therefore not be reached when the Public Prosecutor made the application for prolongation on 4 December 1985. This application was accompanied by the required statements concerning the applicant's condition and the necessity of his prolonged placement.  On 7 January 1986, the Regional Court of the Hague took the prolongation decision.  The applicant reported back to the Clinic on 22 February 1986 and was transferred to another Clinic two days later.  Beginning in July 1986 he began working towards a return to society by means of temporary leave periods. 2.      Article 5 para. 4 (Art. 5-4) In the prolongation procedure, a summons was prepared on 13 December 1985 to have the applicant appear before the judge in order to be heard.  This could not be served on the applicant because he was fugitive.  The applicant's lawyer only has a right to be present in court if there is a hearing. Both the applicant and his lawyer could have known that the expiration date of the two-year period of placement was 14 January 1986 by asking the Public Prosecutor or the hospital director.  The prolongation decision was taken on 7 January 1986 by the Regional Court of the Hague, which is an independent judicial body established by law. Between the date of this decision and that of the next prolongation decision, the only way the applicant can request to be released is by applying to the Minister of Justice.  On 18 December 1985, the applicant had his lawyer make such an application.  The Minister refused to deal with this request while the applicant was fugitive. After the applicant's return to the Clinic, the Minister, taking into account the advice of the director of the Clinic, informed the lawyer on 20 August 1986 that the placement at the Government's disposal would not be terminated for the time being. That the procedure before the Minister of Justice does not satisfy the requirements of Article 5 para. 4 (Art. 5-4) of the Convention cannot be maintained, because this procedure is only supplementary, and does not replace the prolongation procedure, which takes place before an independent court, and is established by law. The Government consider that the prolongation procedure followed in the present case satisfies the requirements of Article 5 para.4 (Art. 5-4) of the Convention because it was conducted by a court in accordance with the relevant provisions of national law.  That neither the applicant nor his lawyer were heard, does not, in the given circumstances, violate any basic legal principles in such a way that this decision should not be executed. 3.      Article 6 para. 1 (Art. 6-1) The proceedings in no way affect the applicant's right to administer his property or in any other way amount to a determination of his civil rights and obligations.  Therefore Article 6 para. 1 (Art. 6-1) of the Convention does not apply. 4.      Article 5 para. 2 (Art. 5-2) Without entering into the question of whether Article 5 para. 2 (Art. 5-2) of the Convention, which only speaks of persons who are arrested, applies in this case, the Government consider that under Article 5 para. 4 (Art. 5-4) of the Convention the applicant is entitled to information concerning the grounds for the prolongation request and the reasons for granting the prolongation.  The applicant did receive this information. 5.      Compensation under Article 5 para. 5 (Art. 5-4) The legal regime concerning placement at the Government's disposal does not provide for compensation.  If it were established that the applicant's prolongation was unlawful because in violation of Article 5 (Art. 5-4) of the Convention, the applicant could sue the State for having committed a wrongful act under Section 1401 of the Dutch Civil Code (Burgerlijk Wetboek). B.    The applicant 1.      On the facts The applicant would point out that the information concerning the expiration date of his initial two years of placement was notified only to the Public Prosecutors of Utrecht and the Hague and to the Directors of the Clinics where he had been placed.  At no time was he told that the expiration date was 14 January 1986 and he was under the impression that it would be at the beginning of May 1986. Furthermore, the applicant was never notified that an application for prolongation had been made on 4 December 1985.  He never received, neither before nor after the Regional Court decision of 7 January 1986, copies of the prolongation request or the supporting documents concerning his mental and physical condition and the consulting psychiatrist's statement on the desirability of prolongation.  Several written requests by the applicant's lawyer for this information have as yet yielded no result. 2.      Article 5 para. 4 (Art. 5-4) The applicant was not aware of the expiration date of his placement.  He was not informed of the letter of 22 May 1984 by which the Public Prosecutor and the Clinics were informed of this.  He cannot be held responsible for not having asked one of them about the date. The applicant escaped from the Clinic because he could not agree with the treatment he received and he could not wait for the prolongation proceedings, which he expected to take place in April or May of 1986.  Therefore, he made his release request to the Minister of Justice on 18 December 1985, in accordance with Section 37 (e) of the Penal Code.  Surely, the Minister could have informed him at that time that a prolongation request had been made against him on 4 December. Furthermore, every official agency involved in this case was demonstrably aware of the identity of the applicant's lawyer.  She should have been informed of the prolongation request.  They had to know that although the applicant was fugitive he could be reached through her.  Because the lawyer is entitled to be present during the hearing of the applicant, under Section 37 (g) para. 7 of the Penal Code, she should have been informed of the hearing date. The applicant concludes that he was denied any opportunity to present his arguments.  In fact he was denied the right to bring his case before a court which could order his release.  Furthermore, the procedure contained in the Penal Code for making a release request to the Minister of Justice is in violation of Article 5 para. 4 (Art. 5-4) of the Convention, because the Minister is not an independent court, and the procedure contains no guarantees for the applicant. 3.      Article 6 para. 1 (Art. 6-1) Although the applicant did not lose the capacity to administer his property when he was placed at the Government's disposal, it appears from the file that the Director of the Clinic was not prepared to deliver a sum of 8.000 - 9.000 guilders of the applicant's money. The applicant intended to use that money to have an independent authority testify on his behalf as to the necessity of his placement at the Government's disposal. 4.      Article 5 para. 2 (Art. 5-2) The Government claims that the applicant received all the information concerning the prolongation request, the supporting statements and the prolongation decision of 7 January 1986.  In fact, he has received nothing and he still does not know what the reasons were which supported the prolongation request.  Only after numerous requests by his lawyer was a copy of the decision itself sent to the applicant on 26 August 1986,  that is seven and a half months after the decision was taken.  The decision itself refers to all the supporting documents and, therefore, the applicant cannot read the reasons for the prolongation from it. THE LAW 1.      The applicant has complained that the decision to prolong his placement at the Government's disposal was not taken in accordance with a procedure prescribed by law because neither he nor his lawyer were heard by the Court.  He alleges a violation of Article 5 para. 1 (Art. 5-1) of the Convention in this respect.  The relevant parts of Article 5 para. 1 (Art. 5-1) read as follows: ""1.      Everyone has the right to liberty and security of person.  No one shall be deprived of his liberty save in the following cases and in accordance with a procedure prescribed by law: a.      the lawful detention of a person after conviction by a competent court; ... e.      the lawful detention of persons for the prevention of the spreading of infectious diseases, of persons of unsound mind, alcoholics or drug addicts or vagrants;"" The Government have stated that, as the applicant had absconded, he could not be summoned to a hearing.  The Government have added that the applicant's lawyer, under Dutch law, had no independent right to be heard on the applicant's behalf, but only a subsidiary right to be present at the hearing.  Consequently, the fact that the applicant and his lawyer were not heard did not make the prolongation decision unlawful under Dutch law. 2.      The applicant has complained that neither he nor his lawyer were informed of the request for prolongation of his placement at the Government's disposal, or of the reasons supporting this request.  He invokes Article 5 para. 2 (Art. 5-2) of the Convention, which reads as follows: ""2.      Everyone who is arrested shall be informed promptly, in a language which he understands, of the reasons for his arrest and of any charge against him."" While leaving it open whether Article 5 para. 2 (Art. 5-2) is applicable to the present case, the Government have pointed out that the applicant was entitled to information under Article 5 para. 4 (Art. 5-4) of the Convention and that he in fact received such information. 3.      The applicant has also complained that he did not have the opportunity of challenging the lawfulness of his placement at the Government's disposal before a court.  He only had recourse to a release request procedure before the Minister of Justice, which he alleges does not satisfy the requirements of Article 5 para. 4 (Art. 5-4) of the Convention.  The provision reads as follows: ""4.     Everyone who is deprived of his liberty by arrest or detention shall be entitled to take proceedings by which the lawfulness of his detention shall be decided speedily by a court and his release ordered if the detention is not lawful."" The Government have stated that the applicant would have had a court hearing if he had not absconded and that, under Dutch law, a lawyer cannot replace the detained person at such a hearing. 4.      The applicant has furthermore stated that since he was detained in contravention of Article 5 (Art. 5) of the Convention, he is entitled to compensation under Article 5 para. 5 (Art. 5-5) of the Convention which provides as follows: ""5.     Everyone who has been the victim of arrest or detention in contravention of the provisions of this Article shall have an enforceable right to compensation."" The Government have pointed out that, although the Penal Code does not provide a facility for compensation in such cases, the applicant could, if the detention was found to be contrary to Article 5 (Art.5),  bring a civil suit against the State for damages under the provision on wrongful acts in Section 1401 of the Civil Code. 5.      The applicant has complained that because he was not informed that the prolongation procedure was to take place, he was denied a fair hearing, in violation of Article 6 para. 1 (Art. 6-1) of the Convention, which provides, inter alia, as follows: ""1.     In the determination of his civil rights and obligations or of any criminal charge against him, everyone is entitled to a fair and public hearing within a reasonable time by an independent and impartial tribunal established by law."" The Government have stated that the procedure for prolongation did not concern the determination of the applicant's civil rights and obligations or of a criminal charge.  The Government therefore submitted that Article 6 (Art. 6) of the Convention was not applicable in the present case. 6.      The applicant, finally, has complained that the proceedings concerning prolongation of his placement at the Government's disposal were in consequence of, and a continuation of, the determination of a criminal charge.  He has alleged that as he was unaware of the proceedings he was unable to prepare his defence, with or without the assistance of a lawyer.  He has submitted that he has been denied the guarantees of Article 6 para. 3 (Art. 6-3) of the Convention, which in relevant parts reads as follows: ""3.     Everyone charged with a criminal offence has the following minimum rights: ..... b.      to have adequate time and facilities for the preparation of his defence; c.      to defend himself in person or through legal assistance of his own choosing or, if he has not sufficient means to pay for legal assistance, to be given it free when the interest of justice so require; ....."" The Government have maintained that the whole of Article 6 (Art. 6) of the Convention does not apply to this case. 7.      The Commission finds that the present application raises complex issues of law and fact under the Convention the determination of which should depend on an examination of the merits of the application.  No other ground for inadmissibility having been established, this application must therefore be declared admissible. For these reasons, the Commission DECLARES THE APPLICATION ADMISSIBLE without prejudging the merits of the case Secretary to the Commission                 President of the Commission (H.C.

C.A. NØRGAARD, President S. TRECHSEL A.S. GÖZÜBÜYÜK J.-C. SOYER H.G. SCHERMERS H. DANELIUS G. BATLINER J. CAMPINOS Mrs.  G.H. THUNE Sir  Basil HALL MM.  F. MARTINEZ C.L. ROZAKIS Mrs.  J. LIDDY Mr.  J. RAYMOND, Deputy Secretary to the Commission Having regard to Article 25 (Art. 25) of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms; Having regard to the application introduced on 17 April 1985 by Rupert Schreiber against the Federal Republic of Germany and registered on 17 June 1985 under file No. 11580/85; Having regard to the report provided for in Rule 40 of the Rules of Procedure of the Commission; Having deliberated; Decides as follows: THE FACTS The facts of the case as they appear from the applicant's statements and the documents submitted by him may be summarised as follows: The applicant is a German citizen, born in 1929, who resides in Cologne.  Together with others he submitted an earlier application (No. 8387/78) which concerned his activities as trustee for thalidomide victims.  The Commission rejected that application on 4 March 1980 (D.R. 19 p. 233).  The present case, which concerns the applicant's dismissal from a university post, is not related to his earlier application. In February 1966 the law faculty of the University of Cologne accepted the applicant's post-doctoral thesis (Habilitation) qualifying him as a university lecturer (Dozent) for legal philosophy, civil and commercial law.  On 24 May 1966 he was appointed to a lecturer's post as temporary civil servant (Beamter auf Widerruf). He remained in that same post until his dismissal in 1977 of which he now complains. During his tenure of the post, the applicant apparently received only one offer of a professorship in a Hamburg academy in 1969.  However, the applicant did not accept it. Subsequently, the applicant made attempts to change his status in Cologne.  In August 1971 he wrote to the Minister for Science and Research (Minister für Wissenschaft und Forschung) of North Rhine- Westphalia asking for an appointment as extraordinary professor (ausserplanmässiger Professor) at the law faculty.  The Minister replied that such an appointment required a proposal by the university.  The applicant accordingly requested the law faculty to make such a proposal.  However, in January 1972 the faculty rejected the request, without considering the applicant's scientific qualification, on the ground that he had insulted the faculty and its individual members in a letter.  In a decision (Widerspruchsbescheid) of 15 October 1972 the faculty again confirmed the opinion that, when making a proposal for an appointment as extraordinary professor, regard must be had not only to the scientific qualification of the person concerned, but also to his personal aptitude (""Würdigkeit""), which was denied in this case. Thereupon the applicant instituted proceedings before the Administrative Court (Verwaltungsgericht) of Cologne claiming that the Minister should appoint him as extraordinary professor without a faculty proposal or that the faculty should propose his appointment. However, both claims were rejected.  The Administrative Court held on 10 June 1974 that the faculty's opinion was, in principle, justified but that the negative assessment of the applicant's personal aptitude did not justify a permanent refusal of his appointment. It appears that in the subsequent appeal proceedings before the Administrative Court of Appeal (Oberverwaltungsgericht) of Münster attempts were made to reach a settlement of the matter.  In this context the applicant again applied to the faculty in November 1975 that it should propose his appointment as extraordinary professor. During the proceedings the applicant disclosed his dispute with the law faculty to the students' representatives (Vertreter der Studentenschaft).  This led to polemic publications of the students in February 1976.  There was also a confrontation between the applicant and the faculty concerning a ceremony for a criminal law professor on the occasion of the latter's 70th birthday.  In reply to the invitation to take part in the ceremony, the applicant, in a letter to all members of the faculty, stated the following: (German) ""Ich finde es nicht richtig, einen Kommentator nationalsozialistischer Unrechtsgesetze, mit denen unschuldige Menschen gemordet und gequält wurden, in dieser Weise zu ehren und damit als Muster eines Professors der Rechtswissenschaft vorzustellen."" (English translation) ""I regard it as inappropriate to honour in this way a person who has published commentaries on immoral Nazi statutes on the basis of which innocent people have been murdered and maltreated, and thereby to set him up as a model law professor."" The applicant alleges that the professor in question had, inter alia, written a commentary on the National Socialist Act for the Protection of Aryan Blood (Blutschutzgesetz) and the Ordinance against People's Parasites (Volksschädlingsverordnung).  He had further pleaded in favour of punishment in accordance with ""sound popular opinion"" (""gesundes Volksempfinden"") even before this concept was introduced into Nazi legislation.  He had finally suggested imposition of the death penalty on the basis of ""guilt by person"" (""Täterschuld""). The faculty's dean reported these facts to the Administrative Court of Appeal in a letter of 11 May 1976.  He stated that the faculty maintained its view that personal aptitude was a criterion to be considered when making proposals for a university appointment. Having regard to the Administrative Court's opinion, the faculty had made a move towards the applicant, inviting him to subscribe an undertaking that he would, in future, abstain from allegations that faculty members deliberately sought to cause him damage.  The applicant had refused to do so, and this in itself prejudiced the necessary co-operation in the faculty.  Moreover, the applicant had not only informed the students of the objective facts of his case, but had shown them documents containing unjustified allegations against the faculty.  His discriminatory allegations against the criminal law professor were wholly unjustified as the professor in question had ""shown a markedly reserved attitude vis-à-vis National Socialism and its legal concepts and had avoided any identification with the relevant views"" (""eine betont distanzierte Haltung gegenüber dem Nationalsozialismus und dessen Rechtsanschauungen an den Tag gelegt und jede Identifizierung mit entsprechenden Anschauungen vermieden hat""). Defamatory behaviour of this kind was absolutely intolerable in a corporate body requiring a sense of collegiality.  Aptitude for teamwork was an essential requirement for appointment as extraordinary professor.  If appointed, the applicant would, by virtue of Section 211 of the Civil Servants Act (Landesbeamtengesetz), become a permanent university teacher exercising his main professional function within the faculty, in which case his activities would have to be co-ordinated with other colleagues on a much larger scale than if he were dismissed from his temporary civil servant's post and became a private lecturer (Privatdozent) with a weekly teaching obligation of two hours.  Moreover, a proposal to appoint the applicant as extraordinary professor would signal to the public that the faculty considered him apt in every respect to perform the functions of a university professor (""Lehrstuhlreife"").  This involved a guarantee to other scientific institutions that the faculty considered him as qualified not only from the scientific, but also the personal point of view.  Accordingly such a decision was of importance for the reputation of the faculty as a whole. In May 1976 the faculty decided also to examine the applicant's scientific qualification.  For this purpose it sought expert advice from four university teachers in the applicant's disciplines who were not attached to the university of Cologne. Only one recommended the applicant's appointment while the others expressed doubts that the applicant had sufficiently proved his scientific qualification since the submission of his post-doctoral thesis.  In November 1976 the faculty unanimously decided not to propose the applicant's appointment as extraordinary professor. On 27 January 1977 the faculty further decided not to propose the applicant for any permanent post which might become vacant in future. The attempts for settlement thus having failed, the Administrative Court of Appeal rejected the applicant's appeals in the proceedings against the Minister on 28 March 1980 and in the proceedings against the faculty on 20 January 1981.  Both judgments were subsequently confirmed by the Federal Administrative Court (Bundesverwaltungsgericht) which did not grant the applicant leave to appeal on points of law (Nichtzulassung der Revision).  The applicant did not lodge a constitutional complaint. The University of Cologne, acting through its chancellor (Rektor), had in the meantime on 27 July 1977 terminated the applicant's appointment as temporary civil servant with effect from 30 September 1977. The decision was based on the ground that such appointments were by their nature of a temporary character and aimed at securing a livelihood to lecturers during an interim period until they found a permanent teaching post in a university.  They could not be transformed into permanent employment.  The applicant had occupied the post for eleven years, but had been unable to achieve the aim of a permanent appointment in another university although sufficient vacancies had existed in his disciplines.  A permanent appointment in Cologne was excluded because of the faculty's above decision of 27 January 1977 and because the applicant's attempts to be appointed or to be proposed for appointment as extraordinary professor had also failed.  In these circumstances it was not justified that the advantages connected with the post be reserved for the applicant and withheld from the many other qualified private lecturers for whom vacant lecturer posts were not available. The applicant filed an objection (Widerspruch) claiming essentially that the termination of his appointment to the temporary civil servant's post in question lacked a legal basis.  It could be inferred from Section 212 of the Civil Servants Act that tenure of such a post was possible until reaching the age of retirement. Furthermore Section 211 provided that lecturers appointed as extraordinary professors could not be dismissed except under certain circumstances.  As he claimed to be entitled to an appointment as extraordinary professor, Section 211 should be applied in his case. The applicant finally complained that the real ground for dismissal - namely his refusal to participate in the celebration for the above-mentioned criminal law professor - had not been mentioned in the chancellor's decision nor discussed at the hearing (Anhörung) preceding his dismissal. However, these objections were rejected by a decision (Widerspruchsbescheid) of the chancellor of 22 February 1978. The applicant now challenged his dismissal before the Administrative Court.  He repeated his earlier submissions and further claimed that the (Federal) Act on Principles concerning the Organisation of Universities (Hochschulrahmengesetz) which had entered into force on 27 January 1976 had removed the earlier distinction betweeen university professors and lecturers, introducing a life tenure as professors for both.  The transitional provisions regulated the appointment of lecturers to new professorships. Nevertheless the chancellor had justified the applicant's dismissal by referring to his eleven years of tenure.  The dismissal constituted a serious abuse of discretionary powers by the chancellor.  The true ground was the applicant's justified refusal to participate in a ceremony in honour of a criminal law professor who had written commentaries on immoral Nazi statutes.  The chancellor had told the applicant it was irrelevant that the law faculty might also have been prompted by this incident to seek the applicant's dismissal.  He had further told the applicant that the dismissal was based on general considerations related to the temporary nature of his post, and not on personal grounds.  However, he had, on the other hand, assured representatives of the lecturers that the applicant's dismissal was based on personal grounds, that it therefore was an individual case and that they must not fear that other lecturers would be dismissed because of excessive length of tenure.  Neither in the university of Cologne nor elsewhere had an appointment to a lecturer's post ever been terminated on the ground of excessive length of tenure, although there were cases where it had lasted up to eighteen years. The university's chancellor replied to the applicant's action on 19 April 1978.  He stated, inter alia, that already since April 1975 the Minister had made repeated inquiries about the university's intentions concerning the continued employment of the applicant as a temporary or permanent civil servant.  This was based on general guidelines issued in 1966 for junior staff (""Mittelbau"") of the universities, according to which a review should be carried out after eight years of tenure.  As a consequence of the university's negative reactions concerning a permanent appointment of the applicant, the Minister had on 21 March 1977 proposed the termination of the applicant's temporary appointment.  The dismissal was thus based on general considerations relating to the nature of a temporary civil servant's appointment which, under Section 35 of the Civil Servants Act, could be revoked at any time.  The applicant's case was a special one in this respect as there were no longer any prospects for his permanent appointment.  He could not invoke Sections 211 or 212 of the Act which contained special provisions for particular situations. However, the applicant's case came under the general rule that a temporary appointment could, in principle, be revoked, and he must also have been aware of that.  The grounds which the applicant suspected to be the true reasons behind his dismissal had not been relevant to the decision terminating his appointment.  The chancellor's decision had been exclusively based on objective reasons and not on considerations concerning the applicant personally.  The faculty's decision not to propose him for appointment to a permanent post resulted from an examination of his scientific qualification. The statements in the faculty's letter of 11 May 1976 concerning the applicant's personal behaviour were irrelevant in this context.  They had been submitted in proceedings relating to a wholly different matter, namely the faculty's earlier decision to refuse a proposal for an appointment as extraordinary professor on the ground that the applicant lacked personal aptitude for such a post. The proceedings were then adjourned pending the outcome of the litigation concerning the appointment as extraordinary professor. They were resumed on 8 April 1981. On 15 July 1981 the Administrative Court dismissed the applicant's action on the following grounds: The relevant provisions of the Civil Servants Act gave the university's chancellor discretion to terminate a temporary appointment.  Sections 34 and 35 of the Act had been complied with.  The chancellor furthermore had not overstepped the limits of his discretionary powers nor used them in a manner which was incompatible with their aim. Termination of the applicant's appointment was justified under Section 35 by objective reasons related to the specific nature of the applicant's post.  The 1966 guidelines showed that continued tenure of such a post was regarded as unjustified if, after eight years, the university did not intend to offer permanent employment to the person concerned.  The applicant had not obtained a permanent post in another university and the law faculty of Cologne had denied the applicant's scientific qualification for an appointment as university professor. The Administrative Court of Appeal had confirmed the lawfulness of this decision.  It was therefore manifest that the applicant could no expect to obtain a permanent post.  The applicant had not proved that other cases of long tenure up to eighteen years were comparable to his case.  He was in a special situation in that he definitely could not longer achieve the aim connected with a lecturer's post, while the situation of other lecturers with a tenure of eleven or more years might be different in this respect. Finally, the applicant could not rely on the Federal Act on Principles concerning the Organisation of Universities.  The chancellor was not bound to maintain the applicant's temporary appointment with a view to giving him a chance to apply for appointment to a new professorship under the transitional provisions. Such transfer was not mandatory in all cases, and in any event it also required an appropriate qualification (Section 75 paras. 3 and 5 of the Federal Act).  As the lack of qualification was manifest in the applicant's case, the chancellor's discretion could not be restricted in this respect. In view of the finding that the termination of the applicant's temporary appointment was justified because he had no longer any chance to be appointed permanently, there was no need to consider the applicant's submissions regarding the allegedly true reasons behind the chancellor's decision and the Administrative Tribunal was only required to review the facts on which this decision had actually been based.  The letter of the dean of the law faculty of 11 May 1976 was irrelevant in this context as it had been submitted in other proceedings relating exclusively to the faculty's refusal to propose the applicant's appointment as extraordinary professor because he lacked the required personal aptitude. The applicant's appeal (Berufung) against this decision was dismissed by the Administrative Court of Appeal on 2 September 1983 after it had rejected a challenge of the judges and also the applicant's requests for evidence.  The Court held that the applicant's right to be heard had not been violated.  Even if the question of the applicant's lack of chances for a permanent appointment had not been sufficiently discussed at first instance, he had had an opportunity to raise it in the appeal proceedings.  The Administrative Court had rightly dismissed the action; in particular it had correctly held that an appointment to a temporary civil servant's post as lecturer could be terminated on the basis of objective reasons.  The applicant could not rely on the Act on Principles concerning the Organisation of Universities or related statutes nor on the allegation that no other lecturer's appointment had ever been terminated.  As the university had submitted, this was due to the fact that a need for termination against the will of the person concerned had never arisen.  In the present case the dismissal had been based on an objective ground related to the nature and purpose of a lecturer's post, because at the time of the chancellor's decision there had been no prospect for the applicant's appointment within a reasonable time to a permanent post either in Cologne or elsewhere. It was also justified to consider the interests of other lecturers for whom no temporary post was available at that time. The alleged assurances given by the chancellor to other lecturers that they would not be dismissed for excessive length of tenure provided no argument to the applicant that he had been discriminated against contrary to Article 3 of the Basic Law.  He overlooked that in his case it was not only the length of tenure, but also the lack of chances for a permanent appointment which justified the termination of his temporary appointment.  In this respect the applicant's situation was apparently different from that of other lecturers with a comparative length of tenure.  For the same reason he could not criticise that no general instructions had been given to terminate appointments after a certain length of tenure, and that the university had only terminated his appointment. It was true that the faculty was responsible for facts which had led to the termination of his appointment in that it had refused to propose his appointment as extraordinary professor and had decided not to consider him for any other permanent civil servant's post.  In this context the faculty had stated certain reasons in its letter of 11 May 1976.  However, the chancellor of the university had to take into account only the actual consequences of the faculty's decisions, i.e. the lack of prospects for a permanent appointment, without considering the circumstances under which these decisions had been taken.  Accordingly the faculty's letter of 11 May 1976 could not be regarded as relevant.  Finally, it was also irrelevant that the university's representative had stated at the hearing before the Administrative Court of Appeal: ""Since the dismissal had to be pronounced it was necessary to think about the reasons on which to base the dismissal."" (""Nachdem die Entlassung ausgesprochen werden musste, musste man sich Gedanken machen, weshalb die Entlassung ausgesprochen werden musste."") The Court refused leave to appeal on points of law to the Federal Administrative Court.  This decision was confirmed by the Federal Administrative Court on 5 July 1984.  The Federal Administrative Court considered that none of the grounds invoked by the applicant as justifying the admission of an appeal on points of law had been established.  It could not be challenged that the Court had refused to take evidence on certain facts which it considered as irrelevant.  This was so even if the Court's views concerning the relevance of those facts was doubtful from a legal point of view.  The Administrative Court of Appeal had regarded as irrelevant that no general instructions had been given to terminate temporary appointments after a certain length of tenure, as it had considered the termination of the applicant's appointment as lawful in the individual case.  That case had been considered as showing a specific feature, namely a lack of chances to be appointed to a permanent post within a reasonable period.  In substance the applicant thus only sought to challenge the Court's assessment of the facts.  A complaint of procedural defects in the establishment of the facts could not be based on such an argument.  Finally, it did not violate fundamental procedural principles that the Court had not discussed the applicant's refusal to take part in a ceremony in honour of a criminal law professor.  The Court was only required to set out the reasons which it considered as relevant for its judgment.  It had stated that the university's chancellor was bound to take into account the consequences of the faculty's decision, namely the lack of chances for a permanent appointment of the applicant, while he could disregard the reasons which had led to the faculty's decision.  On this basis the Court had considered the faculty's letter of 11 May 1976 irrelevant for its judgment.  In these circumstances there was no necessity for the Court to deal with the applicant's confrontation with the faculty in 1976. The applicant then lodged a constitutional complaint (Verfassungsbeschwerde) in which he invoked, in particular, the freedom of expression and freedom of science (Article 5 of the Basic Law), the constitutional principles governing the status of civil servants (Article 33 of the Basic Law), the principle of equality (Article 3 of the Basic Law) and the right to be heard (Article 103 of the Basic Law).  However, on 30 October 1984 a three-judge commission of the Federal Constitutional Court (Bundesverfassungsgericht) refused to accept the complaint, finding that it had insufficient prospects of success.  It stated that the termination of the applicant's appointment was primarily an issue of the application of ordinary law by the competent Administrative Courts.  A review by the Federal Constitutional Court was possible only within narrow limits if the decisions of these courts showed disregard for the principles of the constitution or arbitrariness.  However, there was no appearance of arbitrariness or of the violation of specific constitutional guarantees.  In particular, there was no violation of the principle of equality because even the applicant failed to cite a comparable case where a lecturer had been maintained in a temporary post despite a lack of any chance to be permanently appointed.  Nor was there a violation of the authority's duty to protect the interests of its temporary civil servant (Fürsorgepflicht des Dienstherrn) as the applicant had been given sufficient opportunities after his qualification as lecturer to find an adequate position.  There was no constitutional obligation to maintain him in his post even having regard to the specific circumstances of the case, in particular the age of the applicant.  There was no room to apply Article 5 of the Basic Law.  The judicial decisions were exclusively based on the consideration that the length of tenure and the manifest lack of chances for a permanent appointment justified the termination of the applicant's temporary appointment.  Constitutional principles had not been disregarded.  Article 5 para. 3 of the Basic Law did not stipulate any right of persons exercising scientific functions in the universities to remain in office without restrictions or time-limits. The application of the general civil servants statutes to these persons remained unaffected by Article 5 para. 3. Finally, there was no violation of Article 103 para. 1 of the Basic Law.  The applicant had been given an opportunity to be heard on all aspects of his case before the Administrative Court of Appeal. Any shortcomings concerning the right to be heard at first instance had been cured in this way.  There was no constitutional obligation of the courts to give hints or discuss specific matters if only the right to be heard had been respected.  Nor did Article 103 protect against court decisions in which certain facts or pieces of evidence were not discussed due to provisions of formal or substantive law.   Finally, Article 103 could, in principle, not be violated by court decisions in respect of which it was alleged that they contained wrong assessments of the facts or that the importance of certain facts was not reflected in the legal conclusions. COMPLAINTS The applicant now alleges that his rights under Articles 6, 9 and 10 (Art. 6, Art. 9, Art. 10) of the Convention have been violated. As regards Article 6 (Art. 6), the applicant claims that he has not had a ""fair hearing"" because the courts based their decisions on arguments which had not been discussed in the proceedings and because they refused to take any evidence on the relevant facts.  The applicant further complains that the proceedings lasted seven years and thus were not conducted within ""reasonable time"". As regards his complaints under Articles 9 and 10 (Art. 9, Art. 10) of the Convention, the applicant submits that he must, in principle, be free to express his opinions and ideas concerning judicial murder by the Nazis, including the view that he disapproves of a ceremony of the law faculty in honour of a person who had written commentaries on immoral Nazi statutes. However, because of this action he lost his post as a university lecturer. This sanction was much more serious than that considered in application No. 9251/81, G. v.  Federal Republic of Germany (Dec. 16.12.82, unpublished), because he was not only refused access to a civil servant's post, but lost his income after eleven years of teaching at the university at the age of 55, when it was practically impossible for him to start a new professional career. Moreover, he was not only sanctioned for having expressed his opinion, but he was also prevented from expressing ideas.  While he could continue some teaching and research activities, he was forced to find another source of income, which necessarily implied a practical reduction of his academic activities. Moreover, his reputation had been seriously damaged by the discriminatory revocation of his university appointment. The applicant claims that the restriction imposed on the exercise of his freedom of expression is not justified by Article 10 para. 2 (Art. 10-2).  It is not unlawful to disapprove of a ceremony in honour of a person who had been involved in Nazi crimes.  A democratic society must allow criticism of Nazi political murderers and, in his view, it amounts to a mockery of Nazi victims if a ceremony is held in honour of such a person.  He had done nothing but disapprove of such an action. As his attitude was prompted by fundamental ethical orientations, the applicant must be entitled to invoke his freedom of conscience.  On this basis he claims that there has also been a breach of Article 9 (Art. 9) of the Convention. THE LAW 1.      The applicant submits that the termination of his appointment as temporary civil servant, following refusals of permanent appointment, was a sanction for his having expressed disapproval of a university ceremony held in 1976 in honour of a professor who allegedly had published commentaries on immoral Nazi statutes.  He claims that this sanction amounted to an unjustified interference with his freedom of expression (Article 10 of the Convention) (Art. 10) and his freedom of conscience (Article 9 of the Convention) (Art. 9). a)      The Commission notes that the decision to terminate the applicant's temporary appointment was based on the ground that he had been unable to obtain permanent appointment.  It further notes that the refusal of permanent appointment as extraordinary professor was the subject of court proceedings which terminated in 1981 at the Federal Administrative Court.  Insofar as the applicant's above complaint that he was sanctioned for the expression of specific opinions concerning the above university ceremony is, in substance, directed against the refusal of permanent appointment as extraordinary professor, the Commission cannot deal with the matter.  The applicant failed to lodge a constitutional complaint in this respect and in any event did not complain to the Commission within a period of six months from the final domestic decision.  The applicant thus did not comply with the requirements of Article 26 (Art. 26) of the Convention both as regards the exhaustion of domestic remedies and the time-limit.  This part of the application must accordingly be rejected under Article 27 para. 3 (Art. 27-3) of the Convention. b)      Insofar as the applicant's above complaint is directed against the refusal to appoint him to another permanent university post, the Commission notes that the applicant did not take any remedies against the relevant faculty decision of 27 January 1977.  This part of the application must therefore again be rejected under Article 27 para. 3 (Art. 27-3) of the Convention for failure to exhaust domestic remedies as required by Article 26 (Art. 26). c)      Lastly, insofar as the applicant's above complaint is directed against the subsequent decision to terminate his temporary appointment, he has exhausted domestic remedies by lodging a constitutional complaint and has submitted his application within six months from the Federal Constitutional Court's decision of 30 0ctober 1984.  However, the applicant's dismissal was not by its terms based on the 1976 incident.  The university relied on the fact that the applicant had not been able to obtain a permanent appointment and had no prospects to obtain such an appointment.  This reason was found to be sufficient by the courts of all instances to justify the termination of the applicant's temporary appointment, and it was repeatedly confirmed that the grounds underlying the refusals of permanent appointment, including the statements made by the applicant in 1976, were irrelevant in this context.  It was pointed out that the said statements had been considered in different proceedings, namely those concerning the refusal of the applicant's permanent appointment as extraordinary professor, which had been concluded in 1981. The applicant submits that, notwithstanding the reasons adduced by the university for the termination of his temporary appointment, the real reason behind this measure was the fact that he had expressed disapproval of the university ceremony in 1976.  However, this argument was expressly rejected by the domestic courts and the Commission finds no indication that this finding was arbitrary or unreasonable.  There is no indication in the file that the applicant's dismissal was in fact based on the expression of critical views concerning the said university ceremony. The right to employment in the public service is not as such guaranteed by the Convention (cf.  Eur.  Court H.R., Glasenapp judgment of 28 August 1986, Series A no. 104, pp. 25-26 paras. 48-49; Kosiek judgment of 28 August 1986, p. 20 paras. 34-35).  As it has not been established that in the present case the applicant's dismissal from the public service was based on an expression of opinion, there is no appearance of an interference with his rights under Article 10 (Art. 10) of the Convention, which guarantees the freedom of expression.  Nor is there any appearance, in the decision terminating his employment, of an interference with his freedom of conscience as guaranteed by Article 9 (Art. 9) of the Convention.  It follows that the applicant's complaints in this respect are manifestly ill-founded and must be rejected under Article 27 para. 2 (Art. 27-2) of the Convention. 2.      The applicant finally complains that he did not have a fair hearing and that his case was not determined within a reasonable time. He invokes Article 6 (Art. 6) of the Convention in this respect. However, Article 6 (Art. 6) is only applicable in cases which concern the determination of civil rights and obligations or of criminal charges.  In the present case there is no question of a criminal charge.  As regards ""civil rights and obligations"", it has been established in the Commission's case-law that litigation concerning access to, or dismissal from, a public appointment in the civil service falls outside the scope of Article 6 para. 1 (Art. 6-1) of the Convention (cf. e.g.  No. 9248/81, Leander v.  Sweden, Dec. 10.10.83, D.R. 34 p. 78, at p. 83; concerning a university lecturer No. 8963/80, X v. Federal Republic of Germany, Dec. 10.12.80, unpublished).  It follows that the applicant's procedural complaints are incompatible, ratione materiae, with the provisions of the Convention and must accordingly be rejected under Article 27 para. 2 (Art. 27-2).

LIDDY Mr.  J. RAYMOND, Deputy Secretary to the Commission Having regard to Article 25 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms; Having regard to the application introduced on 27 June 1986 by Ferenc Lovasz against Sweden and registered on 1 July 1986 under file No. 12256/86; Having regard to the report provided for in Rule 40 of the Rules of Procedure of the Commission; Having deliberated; Decides as follows: THE FACTS The facts of the case, as submitted by the applicant, may be summarised as follows. The applicant is a Swedish citizen of Hungarian origin, born in 1936.  He resides at Huddinge and is at present unemployed.  Before the Commission, the applicant is represented by Mr.  Lennart Möller, a lawyer practising in Stockholm. The application concerns the refusal to terminate the care of the applicant's son, born in 1975. The applicant and his wife divorced in 1980.  Shortly afterwards his ex-wife died and the custody of their son was given to the applicant.  In October 1982 the applicant's son was taken into care on a provisional basis and subsequently the Social District Council (sociala distriktsnämnden) of Bjuv applied to the Regional Administrative Court (länsrätten) for the taking into care of the applicant's son.  On 6 December 1982 the Regional Administrative Court ordered that the applicant's son should be taken into care and by judgment of 7 July 1983 the Administrative Court of Appeal (kammarrätten) rejected the applicant's appeal against this judgment. Finally on 14 November 1983 the Supreme Administrative Court (regeringsrätten) refused leave to appeal against the judgment of the Administrative Court of Appeal. On 4 May 1984 the applicant lodged an application with the European Commission of Human Rights (No. 10967/84) complaining that he had been the victim of a breach of Article 8 of the Convention as a result of the decision to take his son into care.  After having communicated the case to the Swedish Government in order to obtain their written observations on the admissibility and merits of the application and after receiving the Government's observations as well as the applicant's observations in reply, the Commission declared the above complaint inadmissible as being manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 27 para. 2 of the Convention.  In its decision of 11 December 1985 the Commission stated: ""The Commission finds that the taking of the applicant's child into public care interfered with the applicant's right to respect for his family life as ensured by Article 8 para. 1 of the Convention. It must therefore be examined whether this interference was justified under the terms of Article 8 para 2.  The Commission finds that the interference was 'in accordance with the law', namely Section 1, first paragraph (1) of the Act with Special Provisions on the Care of Young Persons.  The Commission is furthermore of the opinion that the interference had a legitimate aim under Article 8 para. 2 namely the interests of the child which in this case fall under the expressions 'for the protection of health or morals' and 'for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others'.  It remains to be determined whether the interference was 'necessary in a democratic society' in the interests of the child. When determining whether or not the taking of the applicant's child into public care was 'necessary in a democratic society' in the interests of the child, the Commission observes that it is not its task to take the place of the competent national courts but rather to review under Article 8 the decisions which have been taken by the domestic authorities. It goes without saying that it is difficult to ascertain what precisely is the best interest of the child.  The Commission stresses that the issue in this case is not simply what is the best solution for the child.  Under Article 8, an interference with the right of the parent to take care of his child cannot be justified only on the basis that it would be better for the child to be taken care of by foster parents.  In order to justify such an interference, it is necessary under the terms of Article 8 that the State demonstrates sufficient reasons for the decision to take the child into public care. Those reasons should be at such a weight as to render the decision of public care 'necessary in a democratic society'. The Commission has first had regard to the wording of the relevant legal provisions, in particular Section 1 of the Act with Special Provisions on the Care of Young Persons.  Under this provision a child may be taken into public care if the lack of care of the child or any other conditions in the child's home entails danger to the health or development of the child.  If these conditions are at hand, the Regional Administrative Court may upon application from the competent Social Authority decide to take the child into public care. In the present case the domestic courts found that the applicant had for many years lived under strong psychological pressure and that he was psychologically very unstable.  It has also been established that there were conflicts between the applicant and the authorities.  Intensive efforts had been made by the social authorities to assist the family on a voluntary basis.  It was concluded that there was a need for public care of the child.  The Commission notes in this context that the applicant has threatened to kill himself and his son.  The applicant has submitted this was a 'hasty utterance'. The Commission furthermore notes that the decision to take the applicant's child into public care was arrived at following thorough investigation and the procedure on various levels, the first being the competent social authorities and thereafter three levels of court review.  The Commission is of the opinion that the procedure applied has shown sufficient respect for the applicant's family and private life. The Commission considers that the decisions taken by the Swedish courts were reasonable in the circumstances.  It is the Commission's opinion that the justification for these decisions cannot be questioned as a result of the subsequent developments and decisions.  The Commission is therefore of the opinion that interference with the applicant's right under Article 8 para. 1 of the Convention was justified under the terms of Article 8 para. 2 as being necessary in a democratic society in the interests of the child."" Prior to the Commission's above decision, the Social District Council decided on 11 September 1985 to continue to keep the applicant's son in care in accordance with the Act with Special Provisions on the Care of Young Persons.  Furthermore it was decided to maintain a prohibition on visits and to keep the applicant's son's place of living secret to the applicant. On 2 October 1985 the applicant complained to the Regional Administrative Court about the decisions of the social authorities. The Court held a hearing in the case on 29 October 1985 during which the Social District Council maintained its views in regard to the termination of the care order and the implementation of the same.  The applicant, who was present at the hearing and assisted by counsel, maintained that no facts, conflicts or problems were at hand, which could justify the decisions taken by the Social District Council. Finally counsel for the applicant's son submitted that there was no reason to terminate the care order.  He pointed out, however, that it would not seem reasonable to keep the child's place of residence secret to the applicant and that it would be important that visits could be arranged between father and son in order to obtain a reasonable contact between them. In its judgment of 13 November 1985 the Regional Administrative Court stated the following: ""With regard to the question as to whether the care order should be terminated, the Regional Administrative Court decides as follows.  As concluded by previous courts on various occasions, the inquiry of the present case reveals that (the applicant) has been unable to cope with his situation and he has completely concentrated on the proceedings concerning his son and locked himself up in his morbid suspiciousness.  The Regional Administrative Court finds that this situation and (the applicant's) attitude towards the authorities obviously has influenced his whole lifestyle.  His fight to get (his son) back is his full-time occupation and there is no reason to doubt that, due to this, he has not had the power to plan his own work.  It is true that Dr.  P.F.-F. in a medical opinion, submitted in this case, states that (the applicant) in his view is fully capable of taking care of his son.  The witness M. has also been of this opinion.  However, the Regional Administrative Court considers for its part that (the applicant) still lives under such strong psychic pressure and that he is psychologically unstable to such an extent that it appears necessary that he and his son meet on a regular basis during a longer period of time before there can be any question of terminating the care of (the son).  The Court bases this view on the numerous threats and incidents which appear from the considerable material of the case and on the impressions of (the applicant's) person which the Court has got. All in all the Court accordingly finds that (the son) needs to remain in care according to the Act with Special Provisions on the Care of Young Persons for a further period of time.  This part of the application is therefore rejected. Concerning the prohibition on visits, the Court has already mentioned above that father and son must be given the chance to meet on a regular basis before there can be a question of terminating the care order.  From the file of this case, it appears that the social authorities have also considered this question.  To secure the safety of (the child) and the foster- home, the Court finds it appropriate that these visits take place outside the foster-home and in an appropriate manner. The Social District Council should take care of this, such as how, where and when the meeting shall take place.  This part of the application is accordingly accepted. Hereafter, it is left for the Court to consider whether the decision to keep the son's whereabouts secret shall be maintained.  In this respect, it has been submitted that (the applicant) now knows where (his son) is.  Therefore the Court finds that the decision is of no interest at the present moment and the complaint in this respect does not give the Court reason to do anything but express the view that the Social District Council appears to have had reasons to take such a decision."" The applicant appealed against this judgment, insofar as it concerned the refusal to terminate the care order, to the Administrative Court of Appeal of Stockholm.  The Court held a hearing in the case where the applicant was present and assisted by counsel. As in the lower court, his son was also represented by counsel before the Administrative Court of Appeal.  In its judgment of 4 February 1986, the Court stated as follows: ""In addition to what appears from the file, the Administrative Court of Appeal has been informed of what happened during a visit of 14 January 1986 between (the applicant) and (his son).  Furthermore, (the applicant) has in detail explained to the Court during the oral hearing how he experienced the course of events in the case and his views on the authorities' handling of the case.  The witness M. has described the relationship between (the applicant) and his son during the visit of an hour on 14 January 1986 as very satisfactory.  The Social District Council has raised no objections concerning the relationship between father and son during the above mentioned meeting. The question in this case concerns first of all whether the circumstances are now such that the care order can be terminated.  The Administrative Court of Appeal evaluates this as follows. (The son) has been in care since 20 October 1982.  The Social District Council decided on 27 October 1982 to keep (the son's) address secret and on 15 June 1983 as well as on 31 October 1984 it decided to prohibit visits.  During the period of care there has been no real contact between (the applicant) and his son.  It is undisputed in this case that the contact between (the applicant) and his son functioned well during the meeting of an hour on 14 January 1986.  The question whether the care in accordance with the Act with Special Provisions on the Care of Young Persons can be terminated cannot, however, in the Court's opinion be decided only on the basis of what has emerged during the above visit.  On the basis of an overall view of what has emerged, the Court finds that the circumstances are not such that the care order should be terminated."" The applicant appealed against this judgment to the Supreme Administrative Court which, by decision of 13 March 1986, refused to grant leave to appeal. COMPLAINTS The applicant alleges that his rights under Article 8 of the Convention have been violated when his son was taken into care.  He also maintains that the social authorities' implementation of the care order was inappropriate, in particular since they decided to keep his son's address secret and since they decided not to arrange any visits between them. The applicant further maintains that the decision not to terminate the care order was taken on the basis of facts which failed to show that there was a need for such a step. THE LAW 1.      The applicant has complained that his right to respect for his private and family life has been interfered with in a manner unjustifiable under Article 8 para. 2 (Art. 8-2) of the Convention. In particular he has pointed out that the social authorities' handling of his case was improper and that the refusal to terminate the care order concerning his son was decided without it having been established that there was a need to do so. Article 8 (Art. 8) of the Convention reads as follows: ""1.      Everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life, his home and his correspondence. 2.      There shall be no interference by a public authority with the exercise of this right except such as is in accordance with the law and is necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security, public safety or the economic well-being of the country, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others."" The Commission recalls that the taking into care of the applicant's son was dealt with in his previous application to the Commission which was declared inadmissible on 11 December 1985 (No. 10967/84).  Accordingly in so far as the applicant complains of the fact that his child was taken into care, the Commission finds that this question is substantially the same as the one examined in the applicant's previous application and that it contains no relevant new information.  This part of the application is therefore to be rejected in accordance with Article 27 para. 1 (b) (Art. 27-1-b) of the Convention. 2.      However, the refusal to terminate the care order as well as the actual implementation of it also interfered, in the Commission's view, with the applicant's right to respect for his family life as ensured by Article 8 para. 1 (Art. 8-1) of the Convention.  It must therefore be examined whether this interference was justified under the terms of Article 8 para. 2 (Art. 8-2).  In this respect the Commission recalls that three conditions must be satisfied: the interference must be ""in accordance with the law"", it must pursue one or more of the legitimate aims enumerated in para. 2 of Article 8 (Art. 8-2) and it must be ""necessary in a democratic society"" for that or those legitimate aims. As regards the first condition, the Commission recalls its opinion in the case of Olsson v.  Sweden (Olsson v.  Sweden, Comm. Report 2.12.86, para. 139) where it found that the relevant provisions in the Swedish Acts, although vague, could not be considered as not satisfying the requirements as to the quality of the law.  This view was confirmed by the European Court of Human Rights in its judgment in the Olsson case (Eur.  Court H.R., Olsson judgment of 24 March 1988, Series A No. 130, paras. 60-63). In the opinion of the Commission, there is nothing to suggest that the decision taken by the Courts in the present case was contrary to Swedish law.  The issue of continued care was examined by the competent administrative courts up to the Supreme Administrative Court, which refused to grant leave to appeal. The Commission is furthermore of the opinion that the interference had a legitimate aim under Article 8 para. 2 (Art. 8-2), namely the interests of the child, which in this case fall under the expression ""for the protection of health or morals"" and ""for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others"". In these circumstances, the Commission finds that the decision in question was taken ""in accordance with the law"" within the meaning of Article 8 para. 2 (Art. 8-2) of the Convention and that it had a legitimate aim (cf. also above-mentioned Olsson judgment, paras. 64 to 65). It thus remains to be determined whether the interference was ""necessary in a democratic society"" in the interests of the child. According to the established case-law of the European Court of Human Rights, the notion of necessity implies that the interference corresponds to a pressing social need and, in particular, that it is proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued.  In determining whether an interference is ""necessary in a democratic society"", the Commission furthermore has to take into account that a margin of appreciation is left to the Contracting States (cf. above-mentioned Olsson judgment, para. 67). However, the Convention organs' review is not limited to ascertaining whether the respondent State has exercised its discretion reasonably, carefully and in good faith, and they cannot confine themselves to considering the relevant decisions in isolation but must look at them in the light of the case as a whole.  They must determine whether the reasons adduced to justify the interference at issue are ""relevant and sufficient"" (cf.  Olsson judgment, para. 68). In the present case, the Commission recalls that the applicant has alleged that the social authorities have handled his case improperly and that the decision not to terminate the care order was based on irrelevant circumstances. Before considering the substance of this issue, the Commission recalls that both the Regional Administrative Court and the Administrative Court of Appeal held oral hearings.  The applicant was present at both hearings and was assisted by a lawyer.  Before these courts, the applicant had the possibility of presenting any views which in his opinion would be decisive for the outcome of the case. Having regard to these facts, the Commission finds that, in so far as certain procedural requirements are implicit in Article 8 (Art. 8), these requirements were satisfied since the applicant was involved in the decision-making process to a degree sufficient to provide him with the requisite protection of his interests. As regards the refusal to terminate care, the Commission recalls the judgment of the Regional Administrative Court of 13 November 1985 where the Court established that the applicant was still living under such psychic pressure and was still in such a condition that the question of terminating care could only be considered subsequent to regular visits between the applicant and his son.  This evaluation, like that of the Administrative Court of Appeal which confirmed it, was made not only on the basis of written material but also on the basis of a hearing in the presence of the applicant. The Commission considers that it is justifiable not to terminate care unless the improvement in the circumstances that occasioned it appears with reasonable certainty to be stable.  It would clearly be contrary to the interests of the child concerned to be restored to his father, only to be taken into care again shortly afterwards (cf.  Olsson judgment, para. 76). In the present case, the Commission recalls that it was such circumstances which led the Swedish courts to refuse to terminate care and, seen in this light, the Commission finds that the Swedish authorities had sufficient and relevant reasons for thinking that it was necessary for the care decision to remain in force.  Accordingly the Commission concludes that this decision can be regarded as ""necessary in a democratic society"" within the meaning of Article 8 para. 2 (Art. 8-2) of the Convention in the interests of the child. It follows that this part of the application is manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 27 para. 2 (Art. 27-2) of the Convention. 3.      The applicant has also complained about the actual implementation of the care order.  In particular he has pointed out that the social authorities decided to keep his son's address secret and to refuse to arrange access.  With regard to these complaints, the Commission recalls the judgment of the Regional Administrative Court from which it appears that the Court ordered the social authorities to arrange access and that visits have actually taken place.  Furthermore the applicant has not substantiated that the authorities have not subsequently followed the instructions of the Court.  Finally the Commission also recalls that the Regional Administrative Court decided that the question of secrecy was of no interest since the applicant already knew where his son was placed. In these circumstances, the Commission's examination of this part of the application has not disclosed any appearance of a breach of Article 8 (Art. 8) or any other article of the Convention.  It follows that this part of the application is also manifestly ill-founded in the meaning of Article 27 para. 2 (Art. 27-2) of the Convention.

Estate. The second applicant, F., is a British citizen born in 1970 and is a beneficiary of the trust.  The third applicant, S., a British citizen born in 1936, is the mother and curator-at-law of the second applicant.  The fourth applicant, T., is a British citizen born in 1966 and is a beneficiary of the trust.  The fifth applicant, R., is a British citizen born in 1968 and is also a beneficiary of the trust. The applicants all reside at C. Estate, S., and are represented before the Commission by Donald Ross MacDonald, a solicitor practising in Glasgow. The facts as submitted by the applicants may be summarised as follows. The K. estate is a residential, agricultural and sporting estate in the Highlands of Scotland; about 10 miles long and 2 miles wide.  It comprises K. House and grounds, B. and L. Farms and hill ground used for stock grazing and sporting. Part of the land belonging to the trust (75 acres out of an estate of 10,000 acres) was acquired by the Secretary of State for Scotland under two compulsory purchase orders in order to carry out re-alignment of the A9 trunk road from P. to I.  This land was vested in the Secretary of State by General Vesting Declaration on 9 and 16 April 1979. Pursuant to the purchase, the Highland Regional Authority have constructed a new section of the A9, with associated link roads, bridges, accommodation roads and intersections.  Both sides of the new roads have been fenced in the course of the works. The applicants and the Secretary of State's valuers failed to reach agreement as to the compensation payable, and the applicants applied to the Lands Tribunal for Scotland to ascertain the amount of compensation. Two of the central issues brought before the tribunal concerned, firstly, compensation for cost of maintaining and replacing in future the accommodation works and the fencing erected along the new roads running through the estate, and, secondly, compensation for loss of amenity to the estate from the existence of the new roads. The applicants claimed £335,696 in compensation, £147,242 of which related to costs of future maintenance. The tribunal consisting of Lord Elliott and Mr.  T. Finlayson Frics, heard evidence on 3-14 February 1986, on 16 April 1986 and made inspection of the relevant portions of the estate on 17-18 April 1986.  The applicant was represented by a Q.C. and junior counsel as was the Secretary of State for Scotland as the acquiring authority. Both parties called expert witnesses. The statutory provisions governing compensation in issue before the tribunal were as follows: Section 61 of the Land Clauses (Consolidation) (Scotland) Act 1845: ""In estimating the purchase money or compensation to be paid by the promoters of the undertaking, in any of the cases aforesaid, regard shall be had not only to the value of the land to be purchased or taken by the promoters of the undertaking, but also to the damage, if any, to be sustained by the owner of the land by reason of the severing of the lands taken from the other lands of such owner or otherwise injuriously affecting such lands by the exercise of the powers of this or the special Act, or any other Act incorporated therewith."" This section is supplemented by Section 41 of the Land Compensation (Scotland) Act 1973 which includes damage due to the subsequent use of the land acquired. Section 2(2) of the Acquisition of Land (Assessment of Compensation) Act 1919 introduced under ""Rule 2"" the open market criterion in place of ""value to owner"" when assessing the value of land.  It also applies when assessing the depreciation in value of retained land.  Section 2(6) (""Rule 6"") however provided that ""the provisions of ""Rule 2"" shall not affect the assessment of compensation for disturbance or any other matter not based directly on the value of land"".  So the latter conferred no new rights but merely confirmed the continuance of pre-existing rights to claim for ""disturbance and other matters"" of consequential loss. The applicants advocated to the tribunal compensation on the basis of an inflation-proofed ""sinking fund"" which would provide income to deal with repairs as and when they occurred in the future. They advocated that ""Rule 6"" rather than ""Rule 2"" of the relevant legislation was applicable in their case, namely that compensation should not be calculated with reference to market value.  On 6 November 1986, however, the tribunal decided that the compensation for future maintenance should be calculated by reference to the overall diminution in the market value of the retained land, taking into account the likely future expenditure involved as a guide to the amount by which notional purchasers would be likely to lower their offers.  They found that future maintenance fell under the heading of injurious affection of ""Rule 2"" rather than consequential loss of ""Rule 6"".  In assessing the depreciation of value the tribunal examined each item of claim related to the burden of future maintenance and accepted the valuation approach of the district valuer giving evidence for the Secretary of State, who calculated compensation according to the actual prime costs of the accommodation works.  The tribunal noted that this approach had already been regarded as acceptable by all other owners and surveyors who had settled claims concerning other stretches of the new A9.  The tribunal awarded the sum of £38,100 to the applicants in respect of this item of claim.  The tribunal also found that there was no loss of general amenity to the estate.  The tribunal had inspected the estate and found that, having regard to the effect which the old A9 had on the property and the problems which improving it would have posed, the building of the new A9 caused no general loss of amenity to the estate as a whole.  They did however award sums for loss of amenity in respect of certain specified properties on the estate which they did find to be adversely affected by the site of the new road.  In total, the applicants were awarded £59,830 compensation in respect of their contested items of claim.  Compensation in respect of certain other items of claim apparently had been agreed by the parties before the hearing and these items were not considered by the tribunal.  While appeal lies to the Court of Session on points of law, the applicants contend that the disputed determinations were determinations of fact against which no appeal is possible. COMPLAINTS 1.      The applicants complain of a violation of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (P1-1) to the Convention. The applicants complain that the tribunal's assessment of compensation as depreciation in the market value of land at a particular date makes no allowance for inflation in the cost of future repair-works and also results in liability to capital gains tax.  The method chosen by the tribunal is alleged by the applicants to be arbitrary and illogical and fails to make provision or take into account the likely future repair-needs.  The applicants also submit that there is a substantial physical difference caused to the estate by the construction of the new roads and that the finding of the tribunal that there was no general loss of amenity is a substantial factual error. 2.      The applicants complain that the absence of a possibility to appeal is a violation of Article 6 (Art. 6) of the Convention.  The applicants also complain that the absence of such appeal and of an effective remedy for their complaints constitutes a violation of Article 13 (Art. 13) of the Convention. THE LAW 1.      The applicants complain that they have been awarded an arbitrary and inadequate amount of compensation by the Lands Tribunal in respect of the compulsory purchase of part of their land.  They allege a violation of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (P1-1) to the Convention which in the first paragraph provides: ""Every natural or legal person is entitled to the peaceful enjoyment of his possessions.  No one shall be deprived of his possessions except in the public interest and subject to the conditions provided for by law and by the general principles of international law."" The Commission finds that the applicants were deprived of their possessions within the meaning of the second sentence of paragraph 1.  The Commission finds no evidence to suggest that the purchase was not carried out subject to the conditions provided for by law and, as regards the general principles of international law, the Commission recalls that this condition does not apply to a taking by a State of the property of its own nationals (Eur.  Court H.R., Lithgow and Others judgment of 8 July 1986, Series A no. 102, p. 50, para. 119).  The Commission must therefore determine whether on the facts of this particular case the applicants were deprived of their property in the public interest.  The Commission recalls that because of their direct knowledge of their society and needs, the national authorities are in principle better placed to appreciate what is in ""the public interest"".  In their assessment in this respect, the national authorities enjoy a margin of appreciation.  The Commission notes that the compulsory purchase orders were implemented in order to carry out repairs to and realignment of a major trunk road.  The Commission is satisfied that in these circumstances the compulsory purchase measures pursued a legitimate aim in the public interest of maintaining and improving public highways. The case-law of the Commission and Court establishes that not only must a measure depriving a person of his property pursue a legitimate aim, but there must also be a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the means employed and the aim sought to be realised.  The Court has also stated that this requires that a fair balance be struck between the demands of public interest of the community and the requirements of the protection of the individual's fundamental rights.  This balance will not be found where the person concerned has to bear an individual and excessive burden (see e.g. Lithgow and Others judgment, loc. cit., p. 50, para. 120). Compensation terms are material to the assessment whether such a fair balance has been struck and whether or not a disproportionate burden has been imposed on the person deprived of his property.  The taking of property without payment of an amount reasonably related to its value would normally constitute disproportionate interference which could not be considered justifiable under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (P1-1) (Lithgow and Others judgment, loc. cit., p. 50, para. 120). The Commission finds that this principle is also applicable in respect of compensation for other pecuniary loss or burdens imposed as a result of compulsory purchase measures. The applicants complain in this respect that the tribunal's assessment of compensation was inadequate, illogical and arbitrary. They had argued before the tribunal that compensation in respect of their obligation in future to maintain and repair fencing should have been provided on the basis of an inflation-proofed sinking fund which would provide income to pay for repairs as they occurred.  The tribunal however had chosen to assess compensation in reference to the loss of market value suffered by the estate, taking into account the likely future expenditure involved in maintenance of fencing and other works as a guide to the amount by which notional purchasers would be likely to reduce their offers.  Consequently, the tribunal awarded £38,100 in respect of this item of compensation instead of the £147,242 which the applicants claimed.  The applicants complain that this method of assessment is not only inadequate and arbitrary, but also does not take into account inflation and makes them liable to capital gains tax.  The applicants further contend that the tribunal erred in finding no general loss of amenity to the estate and in awarding no compensation for this. The Commission notes that the tribunal considered the applicants' suggested method of compensation but decided instead to use estimated costs of repair and renewal as a reasonable yardstick to the depreciation in value of the land taking into account the actual prime cost of the accommodation works in question, an approach accepted by other owners affected by the new A9.  The Commission does not find that this method of assessment is in principle contrary to Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (P1-1).  The Commission also recalls that absence of any allowance for inflation, and incidence to capital gains tax were found by the Court in the Lithgow case (Lithgow and Others judgment, loc. cit. pp. 58-61, paras. 144-147 and 156) to fall within the margin of appreciation accorded to High Contracting Parties.  As regards the tribunal's decision not to award any compensation at all in respect of general loss of amenity to the estate, the Commission notes that the tribunal had itself inspected the estate and had found that, having regard to the problems existing in respect of the old A9 which had crossed the estate, no general loss of amenity had been suffered by the estate as a result of the new A9.  Moreover the tribunal did award various sums in compensation in respect of parts of the estate which could be said to have been made less attractive by the new works.  Having examined the facts of the case, the Commission finds that the terms of the compulsory purchase of the applicants' property did not infringe the principle of proportionality. Consequently, the taking of the applicants' property was justified under the second sentence of the first paragraph of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (P1-1). It follows that this part of the application must be rejected as manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 27 para. 2 (Art. 27-2) of the Convention. 2.      The applicants complain that they are unable to appeal against the decision of the Lands Tribunal and invoke Articles 6 and 13 (Art. 6, Art. 13) of the Convention. The Commission notes that the Lands Tribunal is a judicial body set up by statute with jurisdiction in specified areas of dispute in land valuation. The Commission recalls that Article 6 para. 1 (Art. 6-1) of the Convention does not require the Contracting States to set up courts of appeal and that the case-law of the Court and the Commission establishes that Article 6 (Art. 6-1) does not guarantee an appeal from the judgments of courts (see e.g.  Eur.  Court H.R., Delcourt judgment of 17 January 1970, Series A no. 11, p. 13, para. 25).  It follows that the applicants' complaint of an inability to appeal must be dismissed as manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 27 para. 2 (Art. 27-2) of the Convention Article 13 (Art. 13) of the Convention guarantees a right to a remedy before a national authority when an individual has an arguable claim of a violation of the Convention.  When the alleged violation concerns the decision of a court the right to a remedy would appear to require a remedy before a higher court.  However, in light of the established case-law concerning Article 6 (Art. 6) of the Convention as stated above and Article 2 of Protocol No. 7 (P7-2) which expressly accords the right of review by a higher tribunal in criminal matters, Article 13 (Art. 13) cannot be interpreted as according such a right (see e.g.  No. 11508/85, Dec. 17.7.86, to be published in D.R.). Consequently, this provision cannot be relied on as affording a right of appeal from an inferior court to a superior court. The Commission notes that the applicants' complaint of a violation of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (P1-1) arises from the decision of the Lands Tribunal of Scotland.  The Commission accordingly finds that their complaint of being unable to appeal against this decision discloses no appearance of a violation of the Article 13 (Art. 13) of the Convention.  It follows that this complaint must be dismissed as manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 27 para. 2 (Art. 27-2) of the Convention. For these reasons, the Commission DECLARES THE APPLICATION INADMISSIBLE. Deputy Secretary to the Commission       President of the Commission (J. RAYMOND)                        (C.A. NØRGAARD)",,

NØRGAARD, President S. TRECHSEL E. BUSUTTIL A.S. GÖZÜBÜYÜK J.C. SOYER H.G. SCHERMERS H. DANELIUS G. BATLINER J. CAMPINOS Mrs.  G.H. THUNE Sir  Basil HALL MM.  F. MARTINEZ C.L. ROZAKIS Mrs.  J. LIDDY Mr.  J. RAYMOND, Deputy Secretary to the Commission Having regard to Article 25 (Art. 25) of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms; Having regard to the application introduced on 7 January 1987 by Paul Walter HORN and Margaret HORN against the United Kingdom and registered on 7 September 1987 under file No. 13184/87; Having regard to the report provided for in Rule 40 of the Rules of Procedure of the Commission; Having deliberated; Decides as follows: THE FACTS The first applicant is a British citizen born in 1957 and resident in Llandudno.  The second applicant, who is married to the first applicant, is a British citizen born in 1952 and also resident in Llandudno.  The facts as submitted by the applicants may be summarised as follows. While the second applicant was six months pregnant, the applicants (at that stage unmarried) approached St-Helens Metropolitan Borough Council (hereinafter ""the local authority"") in February 1985 seeking financial help and a temporary fostering situation for the expected baby. On 12 May 1985, the second applicant gave birth to a son T. While the second applicant was discharged from hospital, T. was kept in hospital.  On arrival at the hospital on 17 May 1985 to visit T., the applicants discovered that T. had been removed by the local authority who had instituted wardship proceedings in respect of the child.  Counsel's note on appeal refers in this respect to the Social Service's concern at the father's personality and the mother's apparent complete and utter acceptance of his rather bizarre views on parenting.  On contacting the local authority, the applicants were allowed to visit T. once per week for one hour.  On 2 July 1985, the first applicant's access was revoked by the High Court, apparently as a result of the first applicant's conduct in threatening and abusing the supervising social worker.  The second applicant took the view that she would not avail herself of her access arrangements if the first applicant was excluded. It appears that at some stage there was concern whether the first applicant was, as a result of his mental health, able to act on his own behalf and the Official Solicitor was brought in.  However a consultant psychiatrist reported that the first applicant was not disabled from acting on his own behalf and the Official Solicitor withdrew from the proceedings. In October 1985, reasonable access was granted again to the second applicant by the court, on condition that the child was not brought into contact with the first applicant.  However, the second applicant again failed to take advantage of this opportunity. On 11 November 1985, the court gave leave to place T. with long-term foster parents. After 11 December 1985 apparently no access visit took place until 13 June 1986.  On this occasion the first applicant accompanied the second applicant and although he did not enter the room, he apparently stayed at the window and according to the supervising social worker, caused a commotion which distressed the child. The local authority subsequently applied to the High Court which by order of 22 July 1986 terminated the second applicant's access.  At a hearing on 12 November 1986, the High Court considered an application by the local authority to place T. for adoption and a cross-application by the applicants for custody or access.  The applicants, as on previous occasions, were represented by counsel. The judge heard evidence from the first applicant and the local authority.  The judge also had before him a report by a consultant psychiatrist dated 13 October 1986 which indicated that the first applicant was not mentally ill but suggested that he has a personality disorder.  The psychiatrist also described the first applicant as being of relatively low intelligence, forceful, impulsive and abrasive, with an immature outlook.  In his judgment, the judge reviewed the previous proceedings and noted that access had been withdrawn from the first applicant as a result of his behaviour, that the second applicant had failed to make use of her access rights in the absence of her husband and that the access was withdrawn from her following an incident when the first applicant had accompanied her and caused distress to T. by making commotion through a window.  He found that their history of access was poor (no more than 7 occasions since T.'s birth) and did not appear to show much commitment.  He concluded that the child was with secure foster-parents, whom, as a result of these circumstances and of the passage of time, he would regard as his parents and that it was in the best interests of the child that this security should not be disrupted.  He accordingly made a care order in favour of the local authority and gave leave for T. to be placed for adoption.  He refused access to the applicants but ordered photographs to be provided every six months until adoption.  The applicants were advised by counsel that an appeal would stand no prospect of success and their legal aid certificate was accordingly discharged. On 8 July 1987, the second applicant gave birth to their daughter Tm., who lives at home in the care of the applicants. COMPLAINTS The applicants complain of a violation of their rights as natural parents.  They complain that they have been deprived of custody of and access to their own son. THE LAW The applicants complain that they have been refused custody of and access to their son, who has been made subject of a care order in favour of the local authority and placed for adoption.  The Commission has examined the applicants' complaints under Article 8 (Art. 8) of the Convention which provides that: ""1.  Everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life, his home and his correspondence. 2.  There shall be no interference by a public authority with the exercise of this right except such as is in accordance with the law and is necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security, public safety or the economic well-being of the country, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others."" The Commission finds, in accordance with the established case-law of the Commission and the European Court, that the decision taken to place the applicants' son in care of the local authority and to refuse any future access constituted an interference with their rights to respect for their family life as protected by Article 8 para. 1 (Art. 8-1) of the Convention (see e.g.  Olsson v.  Sweden, Comm.  Rep. 2.12.86, paras. 127-129 and Eur.  Court H.R., W v. the United Kingdom judgment of 8 July 1987, Series A No. 121-A, p. 27, para. 59). The Commission must therefore examine whether this interference is justified under Article 8 para. 2 (Art. 8-2) of the Convention, namely, whether it is ""in accordance with the law"", pursues one or more of the legitimate aims enumerated in the second paragraph of Article 8 (Art. 8) and whether it is ""necessary in a democratic society"" for one or more of those aims. The Commission recalls that the decisions taken in relation to the applicants' son were made in the context of the wardship jurisdiction of the High Court and finds that they were ""in accordance with the law"" within the meaning of Article 8 para. 2 (Art. 8-2) of the Convention.  The Commission also accepts that the decision of the judge on 12 November 1986 to refuse access and make a care order in favour of the local authority was taken in the best interests of T. and it accordingly finds that the interference pursued the legitimate aims of protecting the health and the rights and freedoms of T. The question remains whether the decision was ""necessary"" within the meaning of Article 8 para. 2 (Art. 8-2) of the Convention.  The case-law of the Convention and the Court establishes that the notion of necessity implies that the interference corresponds to a pressing social need and that it is proportionate to the aim pursued.  Further, in determining whether an interference is necessary, the Commission and the Court will take into account that a margin of appreciation is left to the Contracting States, who are, in principle, in a better position to make an initial assessment of the necessity of a given interference (see e.g.  Eur.  Court H.R., Handyside judgment of 7 December 1976, Series A No. 24, pp. 22-24, paras. 48-50 and Eur. Court.  H.R., W v. the United Kingdom, loc. cit.). When determining whether or not the refusal of custody and of access to T. was necessary, the Commission also observes that it is not its task to take the place of the competent national courts and to make a fresh examination of the facts and evidence.  The Commission's task is to examine whether the reasons adduced to justify the interference at issue are ""relevant and sufficient"" (Eur.  Court H.R., Olsson judgment of 24 March 1988, Series A no. 130, para. 68).  The Court has also established that certain procedural requirements are implicit in Article 8 (Art. 8), in particular that, as regards decisions in child-care matters, the parents must ""have been involved in the decision-making process, seen as a whole, to a degree sufficient to provide them with the requisite protection of their interests"" (Eur. Court H.R., W v. the United Kingdom, loc. cit., paras. 62-66). The Commission recalls that the High Court had heard evidence from the first applicant, the Social Services and had a psychiatric report concerning the first applicant.  The judge found that the applicants had a poor history of access (only 7 occasions since birth) which showed a lack of commitment on their part.  He noted that the first applicant's turbulent behaviour had resulted in access being withdrawn from him and that the second applicant, who acted in complete submission to him, had tended not to avail herself of her right to access visits in his absence.  He also recalled that the second applicant's access had been terminated following an incident when the first applicant accompanied her on a visit and caused distress to T. by making a commotion through a window.  The judge found that as a result of these circumstances and of the passage of time T. regarded his foster-parents as his proper parents and that any change would disrupt this security. The Commission considers that the reasons adduced to justify the interference were both ""relevant"" and ""sufficient"".  The Commission also notes that the applicants were parties in the wardship proceedings and were able to participate in the various hearings before the High Court, where they were represented by counsel.  The Commission therefore finds that the applicants were afforded sufficient opportunities to argue their point of view before the courts and to influence the decisions taken. Accordingly, bearing in mind the margin of appreciation accorded to the domestic authorities, the Commission finds that the interference in the present case was not disproportionate to the legitimate aim pursued and that it was justified as being ""necessary in a democratic society"" for the protection of the child's health and for the protection of rights of others, i.e. of the child, within the meaning of Article 8 para. 2 (Art. 8-2) of the Convention. It follows that this application is manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 27 para. 2 (Art. 27-2) of the Convention.

LIDDY Mr.  J. RAYMOND, Deputy Secretary to the Commission Having regard to Article 25 (Art. 25) of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms; Having regard to the application introduced on 2 March 1987 by S. against the United Kingdom and registered on 29 September 1987 under file No. 13250/87; Having regard to the report provided for in Rule 40 of the Rules of Procedure of the Commission; Having deliberated; Decides as follows: THE FACTS The applicant is a United Kingdom citizen born in 1922 and resident in Liverpool.  He is represented before the Commission by Leslie Huckfield, a Member of the European Parliament. The facts of the case, as submitted by the applicant, may be summarised as follows. The applicant alleges that at the age of six a consultant cardiologist erroneously diagnosed that he was suffering from a serious heart disease.  In October 1981 on admission to hospital for a chest infection his heart was found to be in sound health.  He claims that his whole life has been ruined because of the original diagnosis with a resultant loss of education, career prospects and quality of life, whilst medical authorities continued to impose unnecessary treatment and failed to detect the error over the years. The applicant sought to sue the estate of the consultant, who had died, and the Liverpool Area Health Authority.  He was granted legal aid in order to obtain the expert medical opinion of a consultant cardiologist (three times) and junior counsel's opinion (twice).  The medical expert concluded that the original consultant's diagnosis could not be deemed erroneous, given medical knowledge and techniques around 1930, and that it was likely that the applicant had been suffering from a congenital heart abnormality in his youth which had corrected itself.  He also considered that the hospital authorities had not acted negligently in their treatment of the applicant's health problems from time to time.  Given the various nervous symptoms which the applicant had displayed over the years, as well as his own description of his medical history, there may have been uncertainty on the part of the various hospital physicians treating the applicant whether the applicant's symptoms were entirely nervous or whether there was another underlying heart disease which normal testing could not fully verify.  This may have left them in reasonable doubt and prevented them giving the applicant unreserved reassurance about the health of his heart until 1981; in which case they had not been negligent. The applicant's solicitors apparently obtained access to certain of the applicant's medical records held by his general practitioner (GP), which were passed to the expert.  From these records it appears that the applicant had not always been regarded by his GP as a man with heart disease. Counsel rejected any possibility of litigation against the original consultant's estate and doubted the prospects of success of litigation against the Health Authority.  He advised that the opinion of senior counsel be sought as to whether, inter alia, the sheltered life which the applicant had been obliged to lead because of his purported heart condition could amount to a ""personal injury"" and whether a non-personal injury claim would be time-barred by the rules relating to the limitation of actions, unless it related to medical treatment during the past six years.  He also advised that further medical evidence would be necessary before litigation could be contemplated, without which it would be unlikely to succeed. The applicant was offered the services of further medical expertise which would have involved a review of all his medical notes.  These might have been made available to the newly appointed consultant on a ""doctor-to-doctor"" basis, but the applicant could not afford the £250 fee involved and no further legal aid was granted. The local General Committee refused him further legal aid on 12 December 1984.  After a change of solicitors and a fresh application and appeal, legal aid was again refused by the Legal Aid Area Committee on 31 July 1985 on the grounds that ""there was not, nor could be made available any evidence to support a claim against the proposed defendant or any other specific defendant"". In about January or February 1986 the applicant's attempt to litigate in person apparently failed. Since then the applicant has approached, inter alia, a Member of Parliament, the Lord Chancellor and the Health Service Ombudsman, the latter concluding that he could not intervene to determine whether a patient's treatment had been negligent and that he had no competence to award compensation, these being matters for the civil courts. The applicant claims that he cannot proceed further because he cannot afford litigation costs and because he cannot have access to his own medical records. COMPLAINTS In correspondence with the Commission the applicant stated that his basic complaint is that the refusal of legal aid to enable the courts to determine his case is a betrayal of legal aid legislation.  He has been burdened with a non-existent heart condition for 54 years, which has ruined his life. In his formal application to the Commission the applicant invoked Article 10 (Art. 10) of the Convention (right to receive information) on the grounds that he has allegedly been refused access to his medical records, which access was necessary to discover whether the Health Authority had acted negligently. THE LAW The applicant has complained that he has been refused legal aid and access to certain medical records.  He has invoked Article 10 (Art. 10) of the Convention which ensures freedom of expression, including freedom to receive and impart information, subject to various limited exceptions. However, the Commission is not required to decide whether or not the facts alleged by the applicant disclose any appearance of a violation of this provision, as Article 26 (Art. 26) of the Convention provides that the Commission ""may only deal with the matter ... within a period of six months from the date on which the final decision was taken"". In the present case it appears from the submissions of the applicant that the proceedings in his case effectively ended on 31 July 1985 when the Legal Aid Area Committee refused him further legal aid.  His attempts to litigate in person in January and February 1986 apparently did not lead to any judicial decision on the merits of his case.  For the purposes of Article 26 (Art. 26) of the Convention the Commission therefore concludes that the final decision in the circumstances of the present case was that of the Legal Aid Area Committee on 31 July 1985.  However the application was submitted to the Commission on 2 March 1987, that is more than six months after the date of this decision.  Furthermore, an examination of the case does not disclose the existence of any special circumstances which might have interrupted or suspended the running of that period. It follows that the application has been introduced out of time and must be rejected under Article 27 para. 3 (Art. 27-3) of the Convention. For these reasons, the Commission DECLARES THE APPLICATION INADMISSIBLE. Deputy Secretary to the Commission        President of the Commission (J. RAYMOND)                          (C.A.

NØRGAARD, President S. TRECHSEL E. BUSUTTIL A.S. GÖZÜBÜYÜK J.C. SOYER H.G. SCHERMERS H. DANELIUS G. BATLINER J. CAMPINOS Mrs.  G.H. THUNE Sir  Basil HALL MM.  F. MARTINEZ C.L. ROZAKIS Mrs.  J. LIDDY Mr.  J. RAYMOND, Deputy Secretary to the Commission Having regard to Article 25 (Art. 25) of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms; Having regard to the application introduced on 20 July 1987 by K. and A. against the United Kingdom and registered on 4 January 1988 under file No. 13485/88; Having regard to the report provided for in Rule 40 of the Rules of Procedure of the Commission; Having deliberated; Decides as follows: THE FACTS The first applicant is a British citizen born in 1952 and is resident in B., where she lives with her husband, the second applicant, who was born in 1945 and is also a British citizen. The first applicant gave birth to a daughter, L., out of wedlock, on 10 April 1982.  The natural father did not appear interested in the child and the first applicant lived alone with L. on supplementary benefit, until in October 1983 when she married the second applicant.  The second applicant, assuming the responsibility of a father for L., approached L.'s natural father to inform him that he wished to adopt her.  The natural father apparently was against the idea and decided to apply for access to L.  In 1984 he obtained from Barnet Magistrates Court an order for access to L., which allowed him to take L. to his house on Sundays from 10am - 6pm and to have L. stay with him one weekend in four.  The applicants appealed, and in the High Court, the access order was upheld, although the staying access was removed. The first applicant meanwhile did not comply with the access order and L.'s natural father threatened to seek an order for her committal to prison. The applicants continued with their plans to adopt L.  The application for adoption was heard in B. County Court in October 1986 and the judge dismissed the application.  He apparently found the applicants to be suitable adopters and commented that they could apply again if the natural father lost interest.  The applicants appealed unsuccessfully to the Court of Appeal on 4 February 1987. The applicants then applied to the magistrates court to have the access order revoked or varied.  They suggested to the probation officer appointed to the case that access visits take place in their home rather than elsewhere.  The natural father however made L. a ward of court on 21 May 1987.  An affidavit sworn by the natural father on 5 August 1987 stated ""this application was made as I did not believe that <the first applicant> was acting in the best interests of my daughter in refusing to allow the access to her despite my requests and the instructions of the courts"". The applicants applied to the High Court to terminate the wardship, but the order was confirmed on 15 July 1987 with the court awarding care and control to the applicants.  The High Court also considered the question of access and ordered reasonable access to the natural father, apparently to take place in future at the applicants' home.  The judge refused to terminate the wardship and when the applicants informed the judge of their intention to re-apply for adoption, they were informed that they would be unlikely to be successful and that L. would remain in the custody of the court until the age of 18. By summons dated 9 October 1987, the applicants applied again for L. to be dewarded but the summons was dismissed by order of the High Court dated 5 January 1988. COMPLAINTS The applicants complain that their parental rights have been unjustifiably violated by the wardship proceedings.  They complain that custody and other parental rights are now vested in the court and they cannot move home, change school, leave the country or arrange medical treatment without first applying to the court.  They also complain that the dismissal of the adoption application and the institution and continuation of the wardship deprive L. of the security of a family. The applicants invoke Article 8 (Art. 8) of the Convention. THE LAW The applicants complain that their parental rights are violated by the existence of the wardship of L. and by the dismissal of the adoption application.  They invoke Article 8 (Art. 8) of the Convention which provides: 1.      Everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life, his home and his correspondence. 2.      There shall be no interference by a public authority with the exercise of this right except such as is in accordance with the law and is necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security, public safety or the economic well-being of the country, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others. The Commission recalls that L. was made a ward of court on 21 May 1987 by her natural father and that the applicants' applications to deward L. have been dismissed, with the result that L. continues to be a ward of court and the High Court is vested with responsibility for all aspects of her welfare.  The applicants complain that, as a consequence, they are unable to make any important decisions concerning L. without first applying to the court. The Commission notes however that L. remains in the applicant's care and control and that the purpose of the wardship proceedings instituted by L.'s natural father was to secure access visits to his daughter which had been obstructed by the first applicant.  The applicants have been able to participate as parties in the proceedings before the High Court and to have their submissions as to the wardship considered by the court.  In the light of these circumstances, the Commission finds that the existence of the wardship, although constituting an interference with the applicants' right to respect for family life protected by Article 8 para. 1 (Art. 8-1) of the Convention, is ""in accordance with law"" and ""necessary in a democratic society"" for the purpose of protecting the rights of others, namely, the natural father and, consequently, justified under the terms of Article 8 para. 2 (Art. 8-2). The Commission considers that the fact that the applicants' application for adoption was dismissed does not raise any separate issue under Article 8 (Art. 8) of the Convention. It follows that the application is manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 27 para. 2 (Art. 27-2) of the Convention. For these reasons, the Commission DECLARES THE APPLICATION INADMISSIBLE. Deputy Secretary to the Commission       President of the Commission (J. RAYMOND)                         (C.A. NØRGAARD)",,
